ive been to various Polpos a few times but never with a large group (8 of us). The dishes came flying in at different stages (its a tapas restaurant) and there was much merry confusion as to whose order of meat balls it was etc. Having been before I ordered the fritto misto which is always great - generous portion perfectly cooked. For most of the guests it was their first time and they really enjoyed the experience apart from having to wait a while for certain dishes. Main course tapas are much better than puddings which are are just average in my opinion (e.g. Tiramisu had much better elsewhere). The staff are very friendly and energetic and do well to weave their way between the tables as the restaurant is relatively compact. There is a tiny little bar downstairs deserted on a monday night but I expect it gets some business later in the week. All in all highly recommended but if you have a large group of control freaks - DO NOT GO HERE - they wont' enjoy it at all - too much mayhem! Great location too a very short walk from Farringdon and our bill came in at £32 a head including service with people ordering 2-3 tapas dishes and maybe one alcoholic drink and a scattering of puddings/coffees/teas etc.
Visited this restaurant on Easter Sunday after walking out of a previously booked restaurant because of poor service. We had a very friendly welcome and were seated and immediately asked if we wanted some thing to drink and were given menus. The food was very fresh and flavoursome the service was very attentive. Would go back to this restaurant if visiting London again.
"The food was wonderful and fresh, I really enjoyed it and will definitely go back. Staff were friendly. Meals were reasonable priced."
"ive been coming to Rules Restaurant in London for many years. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the world. The ambiance is charming and the food is usually very good. When I visited Rules last week I can only say I was disappointed (as were the others in my party). The food was sketchy, at best. We actually sent back the Lobster Bisque because it was burned. Uncharacteristically, the service was DREADFUL. When we wanted to pay our bill at the end of the evening, our waitress was nowhere to be found... not just for five or ten minutes, but for half an hour. Truly unacceptable for a once fine establishment. Oh, how the mighty have fallen."
"Can't say much for the other items on the menu, which ive never tried, but their Frenchie Burger is hands-down the best burger in the world - and ive tried many gourmet burgers out there. The burgers are quite little, but they pack a punch and are very filling: the Frenchie has confit pork belly and Morbier cheese. It's an explosion of flavours.Fellow diners have had more classic dishes, which are ok, but I wouldn't go to a London outpost of a NY-based French chef for traditional French food...Desserts are very good. Amazing chocolate tart, great sorbets and a nice gateau basque, although it's not my cup of tea.Wine is very expensive, and while wines by the glass being served out of jeroboams may look cool, they end up coming out rather warm and acidic. At £18 a glass, that's not acceptable. Beers are also very expensive, so there's nowhere to hide really.Tables are hard to get, but there's a quite large bar area for walk-ins where you can get the full menu. The place itself is very nice, with a striking open kitchen, although the low ceilings aren't my favorite feature."
Low key and unobtrusive in both looks and service - totally spot on for a midweek business meal. Food is consistently faultless and delicious!
"The sashimi platter was superb: capturing art and fresh. But despite the overall discipline, I suspect some London ennui. I managed to get in by seat of pants with some help from my hotel with two food aware young adolescents. Clearly not many young'uns were normally part of the reservation guest list. And my girls could feel it. Asked for a non-alcohol cocktail and initially treated with stunned server face - maitre'd came to rescue by assuring that indeed our unorthodox request for a non-alcohol shiso based ice drink was possible and subsequently procured for them a refreshing and not sweet shiso a plenty ice crush. Very good food if you only go once. I suspect that there is not much variation due to a winning streak and lack of regulars versus tourists. If you are visiting and crave authentic Japanese food, come here - you will be happy. However Question: from whence is the inspiration for the sushi trays derived? Having spent more than 12 years in Japan and having had the priveilege of special and regular dining experiences, I have never received sushi on ""trays' which look like and are the same height and craftsmanship of the washing stools that one utilizes for showering before bathing. These stools can be bought in most grocery stores or department stores but would go undetected by non-native people they are not used outside of Japan and Korea (?). Is Engawa taking the piss? Probably I am imagining things. Just like the way they served me my afternoon tea the other day with the teapot on the top tier of the treats and a mini hamburger on the bottom. Ah well, just put it down to globalism."
Went last Friday evening and was so happy I booked a table as it was completely heaving.If the twelve pies on offer daily are not enough then there are 2 pies of the day as well.Mine was the Dragon Pie with chili beef and kidney beans and it was extremely good.The other was the fish pie with a mash top and salmon scallops and something else but was reported to be fantastic.Harvey's Best Bitter on tap - always a great find outside of Sussex but especially in London.
"Visited with partners family for lunch. Service was brilliant and so was the food, the quality amazing and very prompt too. Would visit again!"
"We went for lunch there after buying groceries from the Borough Market (the pub is right next to the market). We ate upstairs, and the place was almost full (and was completely packed after a while), and was full of tourists (although not uncomfortably packed). We had a fish and chips (fries were okay, the fish wasn't very good), and cheeseburger (a bit dry, although well-spiced). The one thing that was really good was the service, especially given that there were only 2 people serving the entire floor. They were friendly and efficient even though the place was packed. We paid about 30 pounds for 2 people, with one drink each."
"Took my Father here for a birthday treat. The offer for afternoon tea with free flowing champagne was very reasonable priced at £26.50. The service was very friendly but as they were so busy, they seemed to be running around with no clue who was served and who hadn't had anything. We went for the 3pm tea and it seemed that some of the 12pm tea diners were still there, very badly organised. We had the Vintage & the Gentleman's tea, each came with a very watered down cocktail. The sandwiches that came with the Vintage tea, were rather soggy and had no taste, the Gentleman's option was a bit more filling, but as my Father likes his steak cooked, the steak on the teeny bit of toast was not approriate for him being very rare. The free flowing champagne was the highlight of the day. I wouldn't return for the food, but the service was as I said friendly. The dining area was very noisy so I wouldn't recommend for an intimate dinner."
"Went to the Coronet on Sunday 3 August 2014 with my brother for lunch, prior to going to the Emirates Stadium, a very short walk to the home of Arsenal Football Club, we are both loyal supporters.The Coronet gets very crowded when Arsenal play football matches, all the supporters are kitted up in red/white the home colours, and getting a table is very difficult.Down to the meal's and menu's, I had a chicken burger with French fries with a large Pepsi-cola, my brother ordered the roast chicken dinner, total cost of my chicken burger was £7.19 very filling too. The menu changes frequently, they have curry nights also.We have both been to the Coronet pub owned by J.D.Weatherspoon over the years, it was originally a cinema and in the early 1970's it became a pool room then the 1990's a restaurant/pub.I suggest that anyone wanting to eat/drink avoid the Arsenal home matches and evening ones too, any other day or evening is fine. The place is quiet, nice tables and you can take your time here and be presented with a good meal, match events take a time to arrive. The staff are helpful and friendly. Open 7 days a week.The interior has character, photographs on the walls about the days when it was a cinema."
I can't say enough positive about this restaurant. I struggle to find Gluten free food. I went here and they had a full gluten free breakfast with muffins and toast. There was also other options too and I had the confidence to eat here.The service is 5 star plus and it is very stylish too.
"I love sushi. I am from a city that is crazy about sushi. This is some of the best sushi you can get in London. As good as Nobu. They have changed the menu, dropped some of the prices and also added a number of new sushi roles. Our server was fantastic tonight. Very helpful and polite. We were a little hesitant because the location it occupies used to be a dire noodle restaurant. Well worth visit. Especially if you live in Ealing."
"I took my friend here for a birthday meal. We had the 3 course set menu with a glass of prosecco. The whole experience was fantastic. The view was stunning, the decor was fun, the staff were attentive and friendly and the food was superb. My friend was treated like a star for her birthday and given a dessert with candles and a present of cosmetics from benefit. Really would recommend this place for a fun way to spend time on the river. I can't wait to go back!"
"We love fish & chips, and this place was very good and the prices very reasonable! Cool local vibe, endless stream of customers coming in and getting takeaway. Quite different to the fish & chips we have in New Zealand, for any kiwis reading this, I don't get the whole vinegar thing they do in the UK but it's definitely worth trying out! Good way to visit a less touristy part of London too."
With a really good restaurant and the very good food this restaurant is one of my top 5 restaurant in london !
"Continually excellent, this is by far my favourite neighborhood spot in Balham. Stunning food, fabulous service, great value for the money, good wines and beers, and an easy-order carryout menu that can't be topped. Open late, always welcoming to large groups and couples alike, a short walk from the train."
Went there last week with my partner we had an amazing timeVery nice food & first class service .( Emmanuel was very professional)
"Rules was one of my favourite restaurants. I went recently and I had in mind to have beef, but either you eat a 300g steak or 850g of rib of beef, there is nothing in the middle! If you want to nibble something before eating, there isn't very much on the menu, what about a welsh rarebit on a nice bread? So I went for the fish of the day, John Dory with squid. First of all, why serve John Dory with squid? Is it for us to compare the difference in consistency? I have to tell you it was terrible! Chewy squid and the John Dory wasn't very fresh. For pudding, the millefeuille was very greasy (what type of fat do you use - not good butter I would say). I hope you can get this message and do something about it. I would like to come back."
"ive been to El Pirata many times, it's one of my favourite restaurants in London and by far the best tapas. Last night was extra special as it was part of a surprise 60th birthday evening for a friend. Seven of us went - ive raved about this place for years - and all had a great time. Lovely food, atmosphere, staff ... my friend had a happy birthday creme caramel with a candle and a rousing chorus of 'Happy Birthday to you' from the staff.We shared double portions of seven dishes - chicken livers, chick peas, steak, chicken in white wine, chorizo with beans, chorizo, and finally salad (just to get our greens) and bread. All were superb dishes. ive now converted six others to this great place."
"I would not recommend booking the champagne tea. I went on Saturday afternoon and it was terrible. The menu does not deliver what is says, the sandwiches are children's sizes and between 3 of us, you barely get 3 each. The cakes were substandard. We paid an additional £4.50 to have champagne rather than ""bubbles"" We practically had to beg for a refill of our glasses, (champagne flutes are tiny) the menu suggests ""free flowing champagne"" This is not true at all, the waiters and waitress totally ignore you, we had to ask 5 or 6 times for a refill, and were treated with disdain for asking for a drink! Also, if you are wanting a quiet, civeilized tea, this is not the place, it's packed full with hen parties which are so loud we had to ask to be moved as we were having to shout to be heard over the noise. I was so outraged that we did not leave a tip. There are lots of other far more decent places in London to have an afternoon tea, as I would not recommend this restaurant at all."
This is a really nice restaurant which provides excellent food and service. My boyfriend and I sat on the balcony outside which was very romantic and chilled. The staff are amazing here. The only bad part was my pasta was slightly under cooked so a little chewy! Except for this I would definitely return and recommend to friends.
"trip 2 london on 18 b day with family & able to order drinks in a bar (-:pub:-) for first time. my father took me here as when he is in london this is the place he comes to to chill out and be treated as a local. Traditional & relaxed, meals were awesome to have before a night of drinking, british fish, salads & pies & 3 glasses of ale yum.what was awesome of the staff they decorated our table & area for the occasion & thomas & gab came with a cake &sang happy b day with my family.(felt like a local) cool london guysthanz guys for your kindness to my family and mec u next year"
"good value for money in an overpriced city, healthy options are available as well as sweet treats. there are branches all over london"
"Location wise is perfect.just 5 mins walk to the ealing broadway overground.The decoration is modern nice hanging lamps n seats layout is comfy and plenty tables.We ordered chicken teriyaki which is very delicious real authentic japanese taste,The japanese noodle was in a big portion.yummyPrice is standard.but met with our expectation.The only my dissapointment was the rice greentea..tasteless only the rice fragrant i could smell of not the tea..."
"My Mrs has wanted to go to the Shard for some time now so when her birthday came...that's where i took her! Hutong was amazing! Amazing setting, friendly start who were very attentive but to top it all off, the food tasted great and the choices were very innovative. I had the dumpling platter and sliced pork belly for starters, lamb ribs for main with seafood fried rice...and then a refreshing dessert of mango pudding, fruit salad salsa and a mandarin sorbet! Best food experience ever!Currently planning my Valentines day :-)"
"A restaurant that simply has to be experienced.Set aboard the Hispaniola berthed on The River Thames, this offers a relaxed and most enjoyable atmosphere where you can enjoy excellent food served on the upper deck as you overlook the activeities on the river and towards the Southbank.The menu choice is great and the quality of the food superb and all great value too.Service is friendly and efficient and a most attentive Manageress in charge of the restaurant.Definitely well worth a visit - Don't miss it !!"
"We went for lunch as a party of 8.The menu was rather short so we ended up ordering 4 different dishes, each twice. If I remember correctly there was only one vegetarian main, the only veggie starter was ""bread and olive oil"" :(It's a small place which makes you feel cosy although there is some damp on the walls.The waitress was friendly but seemed preoccupied. There were not enough menus for everyone either.Still and sparkly water was provided and not extra charged -although bottled.The pasta is handmade (they also offer courses where you can learn how to do it) the sauces however are less than convincing.Portion size could be bigger and it would be good if all starters would be brought at the same time rather than with 15min wait in between.Overall not bad but some improvements are yet to be made."
"This is very local to where I live in London so I go there relatively often. It's always been tasty and good value.On a Thursday it is ""Banquet night"" where you get a very good selection for £15 a head (I think). That means it gets very busy on Thursday's yet even though ive never booked, they have always been able to accommodate me. The rest of the week it's much quieter and works out only a few pounds more.Staff are quietly efficient. They remain unobtrusive yet appear as soon as you need anything.I really like it and will carry on going there."
"My husband and I visited last week whilst on a trip to London, it was just round the corner from the hotel so very handy. The food was absolutely delicious, the wine was great and we received outstanding service. We didn't have to pour any of our wine as it was being poured for us. Lovely atmosphere and very reasonable prices so look forward to going again one day when we return to London."
Loved the freshness and quality of sandwiches prepared by Pret a manger. They served steaming milk tea and u can also sprinkle some cinnamon if u wish so. Food is fast and healthy. The choice of chips like beetroot and other herbs are truly amazing.
"A great place to kill a few hours with friends, we had a table for 1:30 hours, the time sure does fly by! Great setting with all the tables next to each other and the bar to one side. Will definitely be returning. A good place to bring family and friends to see who's the best!"
"We Arrived without a reservation, it was very busy but were seated easily. Prompt service, polite waiting staff and lovely food. No complaints at all. We will definitely visit again if we stay in Marble arch area."
"I timed the wait in line for pasta | 45 minsTables were dirty Food overpriced & too spicy | I ordered the aribiata only to rocket off fuel in my ears!!!People in heels and heavy trays ( drinks take another trip ) are colluding with all sortsThe queue to pay was worse!!!Best tip - take card , order salad ( waiting time is less than 45 mins standing ) immediately pay , then find seat & enjoy ur meal in 5 mins then leave."
"Sadly, Union Jacks pizza made Pizza Express look like a gourmet place. Smoked mackerel to a large degree managed to escape the bed of spinach and the poached egg it was served with. To cap it all, the beer was undrinkable and we both returned our pints (it tasted more like lager & lime or the stuff Europeans call radler - larger with a fruit juice).Compliments 'though for the desert - meringue with blackcurrants and a tasty (custard-like) cream.Service was slow, but the place was rather busy. Staff should be better trained - I couldn't help hearing an argument between two staff members."
"ive been to a lot of Thai restaurants and this place has the best quality food at the best value! It's a family run restaurant with traditional family recipes so you know it's top notch :)My favourite dishes by far are the soups, the spare ribs,the chicken satay and the pad thai. They are mesmerizing. Well worthwhile :)"
Fuss free cocktail bar!Here you'll get great cocktails served by bar tenders that are concerned about quality and efficiency (not about throwing a fussy show). The atmosphere is relaxed and the price unbeatable.
"I can count on the fingers of one hand how many times I have written to a restaurant following a meal to compliment it. In fact, I can count on one finger of one hand how many times, and this was the place. Very traditional food, well presented and bursting with flavour. I was hugely impressed allow round and will certainly be making this a regular place."
"We stopped on for a late lunch and were disappointed. I ordered the chicken pita sandwich, and it was very bland. The waitress was friendly, but that was about all I can say good about this experience. There are far too many good restaurants in this part of London to waste your time here."
"This is truly out with the OLD and in with the NEW, love this restaurant the menu is fantastic. You have to try the Hanger steak with snails and the Choc pot for dessert, then some great cocktails in the bar after. Prices are set for any budget.Good luck guys"
"Eltham is actually served pretty well with Indian / Bangladeshi Cuisne , the Star of India and Mahatama,s at Avery Hill both of excellent quality , Yak and Yeti is a different experience and and a pleasurable one at that . The Old Greyhound pub has been sensitively converted to provide a warm and welcoming enviroment and the staff are warm friendly and attentive . The food is Nepalese in origin with some lovely twists on Old favourites , the Venison was excellent as was the the lamb chops as starters , the Holy Basil Chicken is simply excellent .the wine list is well prepared to accompany the spicier cuisine with an excellent New Zealand Sauvignon on offer as well as a variety of Indian draft beer . Yes , the Yak and Yeti is pricier than many Indian restuarants but for something a little different and / or an occasion it fits the bill perfectly . Excellent and welcome addition to the area"
"I visited your restaurant in Westfield white city yesterday and to say the least, I was extremely disappointed again with the service and the quality of the food.I understand that you have to train staff but it was very frustrating to myself and guest that our waitress could not understand what we were saying. Her knowledge of English was not very good. No disrespect to her because she was really lovely but I felt it was unfair to us and as well as herself. As another member of staff had to take over.Also the quality of the food was not satisfactory. I have been going to busaba for quite sometime now and it really isn't up to the quality that ive been used to.When I ordered and received my food, the jasmine rice was cold and so was my main course which was the stir fry smoked chicken. I send them both back and again the jasmine rice was cold. I sent the rice back again and changed to the sticky rice instead. Again that was lukewarm and sent it back and then received another. At this point I was extremely fed up and I could not eat the rice.I realise the restaurant is in a prime location and it gets very busy however I still expect the quality and good service to be maintained.This is by far the worst it has been as I have on 3 or 4 occasions had to send my food back to the kitchen. ive visited a lot of your different locations and I only seem to have issues with this one."
"I visited this restaurant on a Sunday night for a friends birthday and found it to be truly apalling. Our starters took over an hour to arrive, the main courses didn't arrive until 10 o'clock with most of the orders incorrect and half our table's food had to be send back for being stone cold. The waiters did not seem to understand English and were truly incompetent the whole evening. The manager did not apologise at all for the service and was rude, arrogant and patronising when dealing with any complaints. The dishes were also very basic and completely overpriced. I would stay well clear - there are far better Italian restaurants in London for more reasonable prices."
Visited this place for the first time after a recommendation and was not at all disappointed. The staff are incredibly friendly and attentive whilst the food is incredibly fresh and presented beautifully. A small place but this just makes the atmosphere great. Will definitely be returning.
"This place is a little gem hidden song Askew Road, to the far west side of Shepherds Bush.We fancied something different for dinner and if been here on a weeknight to grab a quick bit with a friend so thought it would be worth a longer visit.Was it ever. The incredible bread starters with aubergine and hummus dips was as good as I remember.Main course was the mixed chicken and lamb skewers (minus the skewer yay!) with very soft and fragrant rice. Sauces were all home made...The meat was all very tender and all cooked fresh and served with a smile!A lovely change from the larger and moresnobby restaurants that we usually find ourselves in on a Saturday! (Excuse the odd light on the photos - that's how it was lit where we were sat!)"
"We avoided the queue and went down into the basement part of the restaurant. Service was quick, but indifferent, and the food was pretty average. The Banger Pizza had slabs of onion and sausage which made it damp and stodgy. Not dreadful, but a long way off Jamie's Italian."
"To The manager of Rules Mr McMenemyI am emailing you to express my disappointment regarding our dining experience tonight (23rd January 2014) at Rules.I made this booking almost 2 months ago and believed this would ensure us at least a table not outside the kitchen door. It was not only disappointing to be sat outside the kitchen door but more so to listen to two of your staff members bickering endlessly which was commented on by my children!The service was poor. We constantly had to ask the staff member attending to our table for water and drinks. This is what I would call inattentive. When the food did arrive it was very nice but again the wait was very, very long with no apologies or explanation offered. We dined with you several years ago and enjoyed the experience so much that we decided to stop over in London on our way back to Australia to again dine at Rules. Unfortunately this seems to have been an error on my part as I believed we would enjoy the same very pleasant experience that we had last time at Rules.I look forward to your feedback and to whether you did in fact have staffing issues front of house, kitchen and also regarding seating as I do believe we did book well ahead to ensure a slightly quieter tableRegardsBev Mc"
"We visited Eneko after a theatre event at Peacocks in Kingsway. Wow what a surprise, much more than an after theatre quick meal. The mail courses are not over priced but with extra for vegetables prices can escalate. I totally loved my hake which was surrounded by a crisp coating and went very well with my mashed potato side. My husband had exquisite duck with seasonal greens. My husband had the vanilla sponge with basque ice cream and I had a ""free"" ice cream which was lovely. Accompanied by a delicious dessert wine. Simply diveine and worthy of a evening out for dinner alone. We will return."
"Was not disappointed in this large pub - food was good (not great) and plenty of pints and friendly atmosphere. No table service as you had to go to the bar and order which we found a little strange...but it's a pub so okay. Fish and chips good,and there were a number of healthy dishes as well."
"Refers to the second branch in Marylebone Lane: This restaurant/wine bar is located in a little side street near Oxford Street, not far away from St Christopher's Place. We only had drinks and the corner location and the floor to ceiling windows give a lovely view onto Marylebone Lane, while one is chatting away at the bar in the center of the room. The whole design is elegant and sophisticated. I have to say that I really liked the feel of it and the staff was amazingly friendly, even a bit over eager to get ones order. The advice given by the waitress in regards to wine was spot on and really helpful. The prices on the varied wine list ranges from normal to outrageous and one can order testers, normal glasses or a bottle. So there is something for everyone."
I visited on Saturday night with a group of friends and had a great time. The decor is stylish and makes the place feel really special and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Moreover the cocktails were delicious and beautifully presented and the pizzas were very tasty. I would definitely recommend the bar to friends and plan to visit again in future.
"We visited for Sunday lunch and were very pleasantly surprised.Between us we had starters of squid, scallops and chicken wings. All of which were delicious. We then had roast chicken, lamb and beef. These were all generously sized and were very tasty, served with roast potatoes, Yorkshire pudding and vegetables.Unfortunately we did not have time, or the capacity to eat desserts.We would unhesitatingly go back again."
"We stayed at the hotel and in the morning had breakfast..Breakfast options were good, nicely cooked bacon, sausages, and all the usual stuff.. my only dislike was the scrambled egg, it was DISGUSTING and came out sloppy and runny more like a liquid porridge..it tasted as bad as it looked.... I noticed later on people were getting poached eggs so it may be possible to order different choices...Coffee was good and the atmosphere was relaxed although quite busy and noisy....we had a problem with payment as they added the cost to our bill even though we had paid for a breakfast voucher...this took a lot of effort to get resolved.."
"We managed to get seats at the bar though we were lucky as the place was full and we didnt book. The waiter at the door was really welcoming and freindly. The place has great atmosphere, nice decor and cozy. We did sit for quite a while with staff behind the small bar avoiding eye contact, I was beginning to feel a bit unwelcome however once we had her attention she was friendly and helpful. The bread was gorgeous!! the small plates were very nice but very small portions I think slightly overpriced especially the crispy pork salad which had quite a lot of lettuce and not much crispy pork though it was tasty. I really enjoyed the fennel, samphire and lemon salad vey nice and a fair price. When we left we were given a freindly wave and goodbye. All in all very nice evening, great location, nice elliots gin and tonic - final bill not too bad at all. Visit would have been excellent fabulous and fantastic with a bit more attention servicewise and slightly bigger small plates!However I would definately go again and would love to try breakfast."
"I can't get overly excited about the gastropub experience. It may be because, as I get older and deafer, sitting in a large, echoing room with no carpets or curtains and every surface reflecting every sound is not especially enjoyable, especially when the place is busy. Certainly the ground floor bar at the Princess of Shoreditch fits the echo chamber bill. The draught beer was quite good, though, and not outlandishly expensive, although it isn't so long ago that I was shocked at having to pay £4+ for a pint of beer. The restaurant is upstairs and access is via an iron spiral staircase that would be tricky for the elderly, infirm or drunk to negotiate. Once up there, the room is large and, like downstairs, completely lacking in soft furnishings. The tables are well spaced so the noise level is better than in the bar but, I suggest, still much louder than it need be. The restaurant earns its rating through the excellence of the food. I went with a friend. We had different starters but both offered generous portions of interesting and fresh ingredients. For mains we both had slow-cooked pork belly with a duck egg and roasted vegetables. This was an inspired combination of flavours and, again, was a substantial portion. To finish we had cheese and, unsurprisingly, this Arrived as three sizeable chunks with plenty of biscuits and home-made chutney. The wine list was interesting and we drank a very acceptable Lebanese red from a vineyard that, coincidentally, my companion had visited. The staff were cheerful, knowledgeable and efficient. If the background din could be contained, I would have rated the whole experience as excellent."
It aided us in our mission to get as drunk as possible in shortest amount of time possible. Very nice indeed.
"we escaped a London cloudburst by taking refuge in Elliots! Lots of lovely little plates to choose from for lunch including things like salt cod fritters, cheese puff croquettes or girolles but more substantial stuff too - my teenager had a lovely looking burger. No wine this time but I do know they have a super list and knowledgeable staff to help select. And the desserts - well, the chocolates were just diveine! And the cheesecake outstanding."
"Good fish food, takve-away as well. ive been told it's a place you must visit when you're in London, but the Burger Bar in the same street is slightly better :)"
"Having been very impressed with the Islington branch before, I had high hopes and was not disappointed. The Gate is a lovely, bright restaurant with a welcoming and relaxed feel. My girlfriend and I had vouchers from Time Out which were a special offer for the newly opened branch, offering us three courses and a glass of prosecco for £24.99 per person.My girlfriend and I were very hungry as we had just spent the afternoon wandering through the lovely National Gallery, and so we immediately ordered some bread and dip for the table. The bread was warm and freshly baked, with a delightful texture. It was served with a unique and very tasty mushroom dip which really hit the spot whilst we waited for our food. To start, I had the three onion tart which was very flavoursome and had a perfectly thin and crisp pastry. For my main course I had the wild mushroom risotto cake, which consisted of a variety of mushrooms atop a crisply fried risotto with a beautiful cep sauce. The fried risotto was a unique twist which I hadn't seen done before and made for a delicious and filling dish with a rather unexpected but pleasant texture. The mushrooms were extremely flavoursome and were cooked perfectly. My girlfriend and I also split sides of polenta chips and sweet potato fries, both of which were excellent. The polenta fries in particular were very good, the polenta forming a lovely crisp skin around the soft potato beneath, making each a pleasure to eat. For dessert I just about managed to squeeze in a sticky toffee pudding with salted caramel ice cream. This was deliciously soft and light, with a rich toffee sauce which had just the right balance of sweet and bitter flavours.Overall, I was very impressed with The Gate. I really admire the type of food it is trying to do, it is vegetarian food but comforting and filling, with an elegant twist. You could say this was a fancy meal with the presentation and quality, but the portion sizes are generous and filling and the meals to me are classic comfort food. For the location, the prices are also quite reasonable."
"I never personally write reviews online however after my visit I had to write a review. I have personally worked in different retail diners; I can honestly say that this food is fresh, simple and not pre made / frozen like many of these modern dine restaurants focusing purely on profits. Personal Highlights: 1. Variety of different choices of food (Wild boar, Swordfish...)2. Great portion sizes (Great value for money) 3. Friendly atmosphere / traditional Italian feel. 4. Friendly staff (Like walking into a laid back restaurant in Italy)5. No waiting around for food and cheap prices. Starter:I personally opted for the brie cheese starter which was fried in bread crumbs; lovely starter which tasted great with the side sauce provided. Main Meal: I thought I would be ventura's and try the wild boar and so did many of the others who I was dining with. The chef brought us three trays containing the wild boar each with a different sauce. Each of the sauces tasted great and they were very generous with the portions of the meat. This restaurant wouldn't have so many great reviews and be so highly positioned if they didn't provide such great food; I will most defiantly be back!"
"We just went for drinks in the bar, so can't comment on the restaurant. The view is good if you go up to the window, but is otherwise quite obscured. The bar area itself looks very snazzy, but it just had no vibe. The others there were mostly families on holiday, and overall it was pretty dead (7pm on a Friday, a good bar in London would be buzzing!). For somewhere quiet or where you can bring the kids, this may be your thing, but if you're looking for fun, you won't find it here."
"My friends and I all ordered the mixed grill which was an excellent combination of chicken, lamb, pork and salad. We also had a minced pork ball starter which was also fantastic. All portions were very well sized and excellent value for money. Will definitely visit again. :)"
"Having had an excellent dinner at another Cote we decided to try this for a light lunch. We enjoyed a very pleasant vegetarian risotto - and when we pointed out that one of the ingredients was missing, we were rapidly brought the missing item. Although it should not have been missing, we were still very happy with our meal and a drinkable glass off rose. Just the thing for a lunch in central London."
"Went pass this pub after cinema with my girlfriend and thought let's try out a pint here! We ended up enjoying cheese plate, chips, fish cake, and four different desserts! Lots of drinks and wine as well. The quality is exceptional and we really enjoyed ourselves. We would like to thank Sam, the waiter, who definitely worked hard to make sure everyone was happy. Unforgettable evening for both of us. Will definitely visit again to try rest of the menu"
"This is a fun place to get some ""homemade"" dumplings and Koren classics. Friendly and honest service, fairly priced for what is. One warning though - your clothes may smell a bit greasy if you eat there so you might want to wear something that will go straight into the wash. It's a small place close to the kitchen and not intended to be a criticism at all as I wouldn't hesitate for a second to enjoy their delicious food. Recommended."
"This Nepalese restaurant has amazing food, from the slow cooked lamb to the spicy chicken mains. The vegetable dishes shouldn't be missed either. Every time I go I end up ordering way too much and have never been disappointed.The staff are great too and more than make up for the slightly ""boxy"" feel in the restaurant."
"Called in for lunch as the pub is opposite the Travelodge Covent Garden. A board outside was advertising ""traditional fish and chips"" for £5.95. When we got the menu this price was for the small portion. The larger option was £9.95. My husband ordered this - I went for the Steak and Ale Pie as advertised on the ""We recommend"" board. I definitely made the best choice for once. My pie was full of meat and mushrooms with a lovely light puff pastry top and came with herby mash and a few veg and gravy. My husband's fish and chips however was not as tempting - the fish appeared to be over cooked - definitely of the frozen variety and certainly not traditional! He said it tasted ok.. nothing out of the ordinary.The pub itself was nice, handy for our hotel, and the staff were very pleasant. As for the rating, if we had both had the pie it would have been 5 stars, if we had both had the fish and chips it would have been 2 stars. Do try the White Hart but go for the pie!!"
"We purchased a selection of sandwiches for a meeting. They were not ready on time despite 3 day's notice and surprisingly the bred was dry and curly at the edges, the salad limp and the fillings disappointing. I can only imagine that they had been made the night before, or early that morning and then mislaid when we called for them."
"Those of you who avidly follow my reviews will know that I frequent a lot of restaurants of varying quality and desirability. I haven't yet reviewed McDonald's in Stevenage but the day will come. However, I have been to several other excellent dining establishments and I review them all. This evening saw me at this first class Italian restaurant in the heart of the City of London and I was super-impressed. My dining companions were my business partner, Rob, and two fellow entrepreneurs who were celebrating some very well deserved success!And so to the food. I started (Primi Pasti) with a fabulous fritto misto which, frankly, could have served equally well as a main. Prawns, calamari, sea bass and other ocean-based fare, cooked to perfection! For my Secondi I went for the black miso cod and, whilst it wasn't quite what I was expecting (i.e. black miso cod Japanese style) it was still superb. The supporting act was a fabulous Pinot Nero which was very drinkable indeed - confirmed by the two bottles we sampled at length during the evening. Obviously, all this fine wining and dining comes at a cost and at a hundred pounds a head (including wine and service), it isn't for the faint hearted. I did see some chap in there with his eight year old daughter who, I sincerely hope, appreciated the experience.All in all, a great meal shared with some very good friends. One of the best meals, in fact, I have had for a long time."
Friendly staff and enjoyable atmosphere. We had Breakfast burrito and Greek yogurt with mysli and fresh fruit. DELICIOUS is the right word.
"We went here purely because it looked like there was available seating and there was. It is located in the middle of the shopping area which is fun for people watching, but it was chilly out. Thankfully, there were heaters on all of the tables and heated seats so don't let cold weather keep you from eating here. The food was fine--nothing remarkable for a ""Jamie Oliver"" restaurant. I don't even remember what we ate! Service was good as we found throughout most of London."
"I really think I must have offended the waiting staff at this place. I was quite looking forward to it as the now-closed Holborn branch was good. This place wasn't.I don't honestly think ive ever had such poor service in London. The cold welcome, as if my visit was too much trouble. Ordering was brusque. My cold starter left under the lamps for about five minutes, slowly melting. The starter slid along the table to me without a word, an acknowledgement or even eye contact from the waiter. I take that part back, waiter would suggest some kind of service. Plate left on table until my main Arrived, no clearing between courses. After I'd finished my main, again it was left on the table. I wasn't asked if I wanted dessert, although I was past the point of caring. I had to seek out the 'waiter' to get my bill, so I just paid at the desk and left. I wasn't the only person having trouble, the table adjacent were patiently waiting on their bill too.While I was paying, my 'waiter' was texting someone and was in a three way conversation with the two other staff members standing either side of me. I felt like I was inconveniencing their social lives.Two good points: the beer was acceptable, and they don't add service on to the bill. Neither did I."
"Came across this restaurant by chance late last night, looked nice so in l went. I choose as a starter the nann-e lavish bread and houmus, fantastic fresh and yummy. Then I had the chicken scewer and lamb scewer with grilled veg and saffron rice. Some of the best food I have ever eaten.On reading some of the reviews below I was surprised, this was not the restaurant I ate at, yes the service is relaxed but that is part of the experience, this is not a fast food restaurant. I have eaten in many restaurants over the years in this country and others, some Michelin stared and the food I had last night was as good as the best I have ever had. I plan to visit again when I am in that part of London again ( I live in the Welsh borders)Thank you to the staff for a great meal."
"On a recent visit to London we came across Union Jacks by chance during an afternoon trip to Covent Garden. We both had ribeye steak, served with onion rings and salad and shared a portion of skinny chips. The large steaks were very flavoursome, though a little tough in places and personally we would have preferred 'fat' chips to be served. For dessert my husband had sticky toffee pudding and I definitely made the right choice with rhubarb and custard pavlova which was one of the nicest desserts ever! All this was topped off with a carafe of beautiful English rose wine.We ate in the upstairs restaurant (not being aware there was also a basement bar) and loved the hustle and bustle and sound of street entertainers around us.The staff were wonderful being very knowledgable about the food they were serving and even the sourcing of the wine. Service with a smile and a chat.Would we eat here again....definitely."
Coffee was good. Staff were great. But it was s-o-o-o noisy. It was 11:30 and we had to shout at each other to be heard! Exhausting!
"Well what can I say from start to finish the Locale in Blackheath certainly delivers....... :-)Staff were very attentive and friendly, food tasty and an ambiance like no other in Blackheath Keep up the good work guys"
"Stopped in alone for a quick, late-night bite at the bar and had a superb experience. Despite an infestation of American tourists - so many I thought I was out for the night at home in NYC - the staff were warm and friendly. They say a good teacher loves the students, loves the subject, and loves to teach. Those behind the bar definitely deserve the title. I learned a lot as I tasted pairing choices for my little snacks, including orange wines and a lovely, cloudy, unsulfited red."
"I came into the Anthologist last week Thursday for the first time.I had booked a table with Leia and was surprised that she was actually there on the evening to greet us and organise our drinks and food,We had the platter which was gorgeous, and as soon as we ran out of wine, leia and her colleagues ran over to check if we needed to re-order.The service is beyond efficient and I can guarantee I will be back, Thank you all of the team that evening that helped to make our evening fab."
"Good but limited menu. Service was efficient, but hardly effusive.Food was good. A good meal with no fuss. No complaints."
"We had the priveate room upstairs and from start to finish the staff were very accommodating. The set menu with three choices for three courses was more than I would usually pay for lunch (£38.00 inc service) and also was not drinking (much). However that said the food was delicious, had wild boar ham as a starter and the main was Sea Bream, cooked to perfection.There was one young man taking care of 18 of us and I must say he was helpful and good humoured throughout. Some of us stayed on for coffees, which they did not charge us for. All in all an excellent lunch, great space and service with a smile. Not sure if I would return, as prefer to eat Italian in Italy."
We were tired from a long day of walking and needed a quick bite before a play when we happened upon Belushi's. It is typical bar type food but is good and quick. The service is typical bar type service as well - rushed. There are only a few tables so grab on if someone stands up to leave!
"lovely food, quick service, nice atmosphere, great place to eat, I went with my daughter, the menu is good and very tasty puddings"
"We regularly go to the Green Pea with friends for Sunday lunch and are never disappointed. The food is excellent, with serious portions and delicious sides. The service is second to none, as Tom remembers all of our names every time and comes over for a chat. He is a great character and adds to the whole experience. Would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone, but make sure you take your sense of humour with you!"
"Went here due to the nice display and was not disappointed. Plenty of fresh sandwiches to choose from, baked goods, treats, and fruit. We bought two sandwiches , two bags of chips, and some yogurt covered cranberries for under 10 pounds. What a steal! Everything tasted great and we would definitely come back for a grab and go. Also, would be good to grab before a long day tour so you don't have to worry about lunch on he tour!"
"My family and I were all eager to try the London branch of Shake Shack Shake, as we have had eaten a couple of times in the New York restaurant. What a disappointment! The queue was not too long, however when we Arrived at the counter it all became a little chaotic.4 Burgers, 3 fries, 3 soft drinks and two 'concretes' came to a whopping £56. Once we had collected our food, we discovered that all of the fries were cold. We pointed this out to a very helpful member of staff (he is the only reason this place gets one star) who took them away without question and replaced them. My mum then noticed there weren't any peppers in her burger. Again, the same guy sorted it out and arranged for a new burger to come, by which time everyone else had finished, and our concretes had melted into a liquid mess. We explained this to another member of staff, and asked if it would be possible to replace the concretes. To cut a long story short, the woman refused to change the concretes because I had taken a spoonful out of one of them. I asked to speak to a manager, and she told me she was the manager, which was surprising given her rude and argumentative attitude. After what seemed like a very lengthy discussion , I said I wasn't prepared to sit there and argue with her for any longer, and asked for a refund. Ultimately we had a very poor dining experience. The so-called manager had no customer service skills whatsoever, and even with the £14 refund, the meal was still overpriced for what it was. This place falls short of the New York counterparts, and there are several much better burger outlets in London (i.e Patty & Bun, Meatliquor). Go elsewhere!"
"Recognising the comments of others this might not be a place to go for a quick ""in and out"" meal as the service is not lightening fast, however the people who served us were very friendly and helpful. Personally, I think the issue is an internal organisation one rather than a lack of willingness. We did have to ask more times than is sensible for some tap water but as we were chatting away merrily and our wine was served promptly we weren't really unhappy at the length of time it took to get our dinner. The Singapore Fried Noodles were spicy and plentiful, the Phad Thai was tasty and the vegetable Katsu was a big hit. In fact we took the leftovers home with us. We had fun and paid a fair price for London and were happy with the friendliness of the service."
Waw. .. never saw such a mafia in Central London. .. How can this people control that without the police not notice?A 50's man control the doorman(a tattoo guy... was the most understanding. .. said that he had no power) and a lady manager(on her 20's) put my father and my mum out cause they were not suitable for that place.... they are on them 60's.... lol.....Great place. .. really bad management. .. had to ask please to that doorman to get my mum coat. ...TO AVOID IF U NOT YOUNG ENOUGH..... OR U NOT POLISH
"Fried chicken is king in London but a fancy place to experiment new combinations was needed. Chick'n'sours fills the gap in Seven Dials.Great staff throughout my visit, smiling and efficient; dining room is in the basement and very basic furniture can be found but dimmed quirky lights makes quite an atmosphere to enjoy. Plus, the pungent smell of sour sauces was quite hipster-like.My chicken tenders were odd enough but tasty, fries decent but quite average. Dessert menu a bit limited and too American-style. Large range of cocktails available.Good for a quick meal with friends (ground floor offers take-away), average prices."
Four of us went to this new - at least to us - restaurant last night.Ambience perfect.So quiet we could talk across the table without any raised voices and no chance of overhearing other people's unwanted conversationsTables well apartFood extremely good and beautifully presented.Cuisine at its best.Service immaculateWine list superbAll in all a great eating experience.Thank you Chef and all the staff.We will be back!
"We were a part of a group of 12, so were eating from a set menu.Although the set menu was very limited (and an absolute no no if you are a vegetarian, as two out of three mains were red meat and the third was smoked fish), I feel compelled to write this review as the lamb was just amazing. Worth the visit alone - most certainly a come back too - although must be noted that some of the other food has not been quite in the same league.The sommelier's choice of Sauvignon Blanc was very good indeed as well. Service was discreet and slick and definitely not making us feel awkward for surely being a bit too loud at times - most appreciated!!Definitely a place to look up if you are that awkward mid-sized group, too big for a la carte but too small for a priveate dining room."
"Have tried several branches if Strada and consistently good. We had 2 trips in 3 days to St Katharine Docks. We sat outside and enjoyed the warm weather. Really impressed with the food and the service, attentive servers, very helpful and very cheerful. Thought the prices were good too. Would recommend thus place for lunch or dinner. It's adjacent to other restaurants and if you can sit outside there's a real buzz about the place when it's busy."
"My family and I booked this restaurant because it was located near our hotel, the Apex Temple Court.As luck would have it, the restaurant is very nice. It's in a downstairs location, quite small but lovely.Good service and VERY good food. We had a few small starters (chorizo and meat) which were splendid and indeed cheap. Main course was steaks and they were all perfect.Thank you!"
"Lovely place, traditional tea with scones and delicious macaroons. Tea is good, service formal but efficient and courteous. Very good location on Regent street, near Piccadilly"
"when it Arrived the fish stew looked very good and was dressed with fennel and fresh herbs, however the fish had a nasty taste and smell which tainted the entire dish and I was unable to eat any of it . The Waitress briefly stopped by to ask if everything was OK but did not give me time to answer her - I was chewing a piece of bread- before she was off again. When I finally managed to attract her attention she told me that she had already asked if everything was OK . I was not charged for this main course, nor was I offered an alternative or an apology which I think would have been appropriate given the circumstances. My husband's meal of chicken was good and he enjoyed it."
"Wonderful, luxury and comfortable rooms to a really nice price. Close to Farringdon Station and just 15 minutes walk from Convent garden. no elevator."
Two of us ate here and we had main courses and desserts and drinks. Viveiane our waitress was really good and courteous and very helpful. We did have an issue with the onion rings not being hot and she quickly rectified the problem and replaced them with a new very hot serving. She also clarified dishes on the menu and made sure we were satisfied with everything. She is a great asset to the restaurant.It may have lost its edge from previous occasions and the menu was not as extensive as I remember it in the past however what we order was good and worth considering for a reasonable priced meal if you are in the area
"Great attention to detail, very professional waiting staff, food is not bad either. Hampstead is lucky to have a West End Restaurant in a lane just off the High Street.Didn't realise that this place has been here for over 40 years!!Highly Recommended."
I used to make this my favourite friday night 6pm fish & chips chill at home night. Cod and chips are still good .. but the problem is the service .. not the restaurant but the takeaway. The restaurant is a farce as well because you can just pick up the same for 4-5 £ less in the take away. When I first went there it was bustling people in and out (3yrs ago) then last year a young kid seemed like his first day on the job...okay they needed to train him on a fast food type environment .. now .. 5 idiots being managed by the same kid looking over 1 person's small fish & chip order while the whole time a queu is building and people are made to wait over 30 minutes for FISH N CHIPS (but the wait was only supposed to be 15-20 minutes). and a total of 8 people oredering so not like the place was 30 poeple deep. Money is being lost and not sure who runs this place but they lost the plot. I will not be wasting my time going here again. Sad because I don't mind paying up for the extremely expensive food here but the service is so unbearable for such a simple meal. Many other chippies as good around. I give this place 1 more year until it closes. I can tell you 5 of 8 people that were waiting with me said the same thing... LAST TIME I COME HERE
"The small quaint restaurant is off the main road of Tottenham Count. The owners come and personally greet you and make you feel welcomed. I ate the Scallopine Sophia Loren and it was fabulous. I love to eat Italian food and this place by far is the best that I have been to. So if you are in the London area go see Maria, Silvana, & Filippo for some wonderful meals."
"Myself and 5 girlfriends had afternoon tea on Wednesday 7th December 2011. We were welcomed with genuine warmth & hospitality by Luis, the maitre dix while a pianist played melodies on a grand piano. Our table was set with crisp linen (no paper napkins here!) blue water glasses, jugs of iced water and quality Christmas crackers. The food Arrived and wow! - fresh appetising sandwiches (smoked salmon, turkey & cranberry chutney,ham and the best egg mayonaise I have ever tasted. Slices of apple tart with fresh strawberries dusted in icing sugar, home-made scones and shortbread biscuits that literally melted in our mouth and slices of fruit cake. More sandwiches Arrived! Then a plate of miniature mince pies Arrived (not mentioned on the website) We had endless pots of tea served as well. We couldn't eat all the food and asked for a 'doggy bag' which the charming waitress packed up for us. Nazrul the waiter was charming too. We returned later in the evening for a glass of wine and Luis offered us an extra complimentary glass of hot mulled wine. A lovely touch we thought. We are already planning a return visit to London in 2012 and plan to have lunch or dinner on the Hispaniola as we had SUCH a lovely time and didn't want to leave. I'd researched every 'afternoon tea' destination in London and without doubt the Hispaniola came out top of the list for setting (opposite the London Eye), hospitality, excellent food and wine . I am amazed at some of the lack-lustre reviews and can only say we all had a wonderful experience which we intend to repeat every time we visit London."
Amazing food at really affordable prices! The wonderful service really made us feel equally special and at home. Reggie's is our new Caribbean home.
"We visitied this restaurant last year and were pleased with their food. However, when we tried them again last week, the standard was nothing like what it used to be. The chiii garlic squid was tough like rubber and the meat in our 'Pho' contained pieces that resembled offal rather than beef. Other dishes such as the 'Combo' was poor value for money. Definitely will not be returning."
"We ate here with the kids before we went to the theater. The paper thin pizza is good for kids as it is quick and very basic. My husband and I ordered burgers, and the restaurant only serves them well done which gave the burger an odd taste. The servers were very pleasant and attentive."
"if you are looking for a healthy food and organic coffee, then you are in the right place offering these options, very good place to have simple healthy sandwich with an organic coffee"
I have been here twice for afternoon tea and both times were highly enjoyable with a lovely atmosphere and exceptional service. The afternoon tea is also reasonable and making a reservation online was very easy.
"We enjoyed the Dover Sole at dinner. This new restaurant in the Savoy is attractive and imaginative however we prefer the understated atmosphere and Muzak free ambiance of the former River Restaurant. We missed the Irish linen tablecloths and napkins and were surprised that the silver flatware is set on the uncovered tabletop.When we mentioned this unsanitary practice to manager he said that they did a competitive survey and other restaurants were doing the same. The Savoy used to set the highest standards that other establishments would follow, they did not lower their standards to follow fads."
"Enjoyed delicious salt beef sandwiches today in 'The Feathers' My husband also enjoyed a very good pint of Guinness. Staff were very pleasant altogether with a good atmosphere throughout. Food was served very nicely and the fries were very good. Would just suggest that 'chefs' clothing be a little whiter, think owner should invest in new ones!"
"The food is pretty awful...I had chicken strips for a main and they were dry and tasteless. The waitress was lovely, but the front of house was hassled and rude."
"Can't fault the food. But nearly 1 hour wait between courses left us ravenous, so this may have swayed our impression of the food but I would say it was delicious .Or may be I was delirious. So not sure why there was such a delay.They could have offered us a complementary drink but this was not forth coming.Lunch ended up at tea time so not a place to go unless you would like to combine the dinning."
"We visited this restaurant in Covent Garden before going to the theatre. We had heard mixed reviews about some of Jamie's restaurants and thought we'd give it a try ourselves.All I can say is, don't bother. The food is way too overpriced for what you get. The steak was not cooked as I had asked, even my partner could not finish his meal and he eats anything! The chips were soggy. There was only a few options for desert and even that didn't taste nice. The location is not good- it started raining while we were there and coming through the roof, we had to keep our coats on as there was only a tiny heater on some of the seats that literally only kept your ankles warm. All the staff looked freezing. Had to ask four times for the bill, the waitress said she'd get it and then walked off to talk to her mates at the front of the restaurant. We were in a hurry to get to the theatre by then, and in the end we just stood up and went to leave and she finally came running over with it. Would not eat there again, I am usually very fair with reviews but there is hardly anything good I can think of about this restaurant."
"I have been to other branches of Busaba and was surprised how empty this one was on a bank holiday Saturday. Maybe it was because it was a nice day and no outdoor seating???Overall, nice dining experience but the food was lukewarm and saltier than the other branches which surprised me. Also they ran out of certain teas etc.Good service though."
I visited Rosspomodoro Oxford Street for a family lunch it was just great food specialy pizza verace it was just fantastic and service was great
"We went mid week to Borough market by a very cold June day. I was disappointed that none of the previous Thai food stalls were available that day. So as it was so cold we decided to go for a good old fashion 'pub grub' at the Market Porter opposite. We ordered the ale and stilton pie and the burger. My pie was delicious. The green vegetables cooked to perfection, Crunchy and well cooked with a beautiful shade of green to match! My partner's burger was also very good and the chips were perfect. The room had a few French people eating in there who seemed to equally enjoy the food on their plate. The dining room is oak panelled and old English style, very cosy. We sat by the window and observed all the goings on in the market opposite and were warm. All in all we enjoyed the sitting down break very much. I recommend this place, especially to visitors from overseas who want to sample good English traditional fare."
"Healthy and good value, love the hummus wrap and the veggie baguettes. can't fault anything."
We had excellent fish and chips at a reasonable price for lunch. An easy to find location on Lisson Grove.
"Nice end of a long shopping day. At every important corner you can find a Bella Italia restaurant. Nice presented, delicious food, friendly staff. Good prices."
Very healthy and quick food. It is super clean and always tempting. I like the fact that they write every single ingredient of the food to the cover.
Fantastic range of beers on offer for a very reasonable price. Friendly crowd of beer aficionados who are always more than happy to share their advice. Board games available. There is also pretty if not somewhat small paved garden out back and a marquee for their regular and highly popular beer festiveals. Really enjoyed visiting this pub.
"This year we attended the Chelsea Flower show and invited guests from Germany to join us. We decided to take them to Rules and it turned out to be an excellent decision. I had a special request regarding the seating and this was honouredI am a regular visitor to Rules and have never been disappointed and my guests had been once 20 years earlier and were absolutely delighted with the atmosphere, the excellent service and the food. My guest is an expert on wine and found the winery and the wine he was looking for and we all had a thoroughly enjoyable evening."
"We have eaten several times at the Alleyns Head when visiting the Dulwich Picture Gallery and have had enjoyable meals each time.It's around a 15 minute walk from the gallery and a short stroll to West Dulwich station.For fans of real ale, there's a good selection of bitter and on Sundays, all bottles of wine are just £10.Yesterday, I had potato and black pudding to start, sea bass for main course and Black Forest sundae for dessert. The cost for four of us including drinks and liquor coffees was £77.The service was very good from the pleasant waitresses and I'm looking forward to dining there again soon."
Drinks and staff were great. Hesitant on the avocado chocolate mousse for dessert but was great just like rest of meal.
"We had a super Sunday lunch at this unusual food haven. The quirky decor is quite trendy but the food matched the odd facade! Pate as good as I have had anywhere, the salt pastry wrapped chicken was very good and the portions excellent. Wine was also exceptional value.You would be overly critical not to enjoy what's on offer here at the price. It is worth the trip as it's not the easiest to find."
"I have lived near the White Hart for about 7 years and in all that time must have popped in twice. It was basically a dump and after witnessing a fight, decided I'd never return. Since the refurb we have been back four times, three times having a meal. I can't believe the difference. A really solid wine and food menu, a totally different crowd (with people coming in and then leaving as they can't get a table), and charming staff. I was last there on Sunday - we popped in for a quick drink and ended up staying three hours to listen to the jazz octet that was playing. I'll definitely be a regular."
Booked a deal via bookatable. We thought this place might be a bit snobby and waiters may look down at us as we not the usual rich clientele how wrong we was.. everyone from reception to waiters where all extremely friendly and couldn't do enough to make the visit as memorable as it was. .One of the reasons we chose the Dorchester was because they do Halal meat so that was a bonus for me and the meal I had was lovely. ..all in all it certainly was a bargain. .. one of the world's best hotels a 3 course meal with a glass of champagne ( or non alcoholic ) for less then £100 will certainly return.
"We Arrived at 22h30 and although the restaurant was becoming quieter, the service was excellent.The food was hot and Arrived in record time. Service and waiters were attentive."
Excellent food with stunning service. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fine Italian dining experience.
"Overall, the food is fantastic! The service, portions, prices and restaurant itself were are also good. We can't wait to go back to Itsadaki Zen when we are in London next!We Arrived at the restaurant at 12:26pm; since they open at 12:30, the restaurant had a closed sign on the window but we noticed some people inside. We waited around the corner for a few minutes and returned at 12:30pm with the same people seated inside. The nice waitress took us to a table in the small but nice restaurant. It seems that she had forgotten to turn the sign around and did so after we entered. She explained lunch menu to us and we settled on a bento box and a bowl of udon noodles with tempura in broth. Both were delicious and it is one of the best pan-Asian restaurants ive been to!!!! The food was just well seasoned, all good temperatures and portions, not to mention reasonably priced. The service was efficiently and nice. The restaurant itself could use an upgrade especially the downstairs where the bathrooms are which is why I was not surprised by the 3/5 food safety rating. Nonetheless we had no issues and everything was great!"
I dont know about the hotel-so no commentThe pub is niceThe people are friendly but the food is not good value for moneyJust paid £10 for turkey sunday special carvery with a very thin and only little piece of turkeyFor the beef the put 2-3 slicesI asked why and i didnt get a satisfactory answer2-3weeks ago we had the sticky toffee. It came without the ice cream (even if it was addressed with ice cream on the menu)I asked for the icecream i paidAnd they werent happy with that!!! I had to show to them the menuSo they added a tiny amount to please usI will keep visiting the pub just for drinks And never again for food
"ive run annual luncheons here for around 40 people for a few years now, and despite the numbers the staff are all charming, funny and extremely helpful. John was a fantastic host.It's a great looking pub, really charming features and the priveate dining room is particularly attractive. Food wise they've got a lovely selection, with well sourced ingredients and generally interesting choices alongside the classic pub dishes. I was also very fond of the selection of beers available and the range of wines. Great pub, always worth a visit."
"Lovely (but small) bar, we went here before Whisky Mist and the cocktails were amazing!!! There are lovely staff and people in the bar with a great atmosphere. The only thing I would say is the cocktails aren't cheap, but you would expect this from a venue due to its location"
Nothing special decent food at reasonable prices for London but doesnt stand out from amny others im afraid
"Firstly we did dine lateish @2.30pm Sunday when staff complement was noticeably lower than on Saturday! No Head Barman but good cocktail made with care by young lady Barman! I thought choice for Sunday lunch was a bit limited especially for me as a nuisance lactose intolerant! There was really only one starter for me but it was a delicious spicy Gazpacho, perfect on a hot weekend! I asked for my Roast beef mains to be rare but told only medium available at that time?! It was awesome beef but would have been better if how I like it!! Vegetables uninspiring - served on dinner plate to share but a bit undercooked, naked and under seasoned and Roasties were soggy! Out of choice of 5 desserts I was told nothing was suitable for me as all had cream and I was offered fruit salad/platter or sorbet needless to say I passed on dessert so hubby did as well! Staff were friendly but a little thin on ground and all in all disappointed not up to reviews I read on here!"
"we had lunch here. Waited some time for our food but it was worth it. Sea bass served in a delicious sauce, really lovely. Would recommend"
The passion of Jamie to his food and inspiration can be taste in the menu. Sat there with the all family and we loved everything we order. And thanks to the Spanish waiter for his best service.
Good service and friendly staff however the food is average on the whole for dinner with nothing particularly outstanding!! Vegetarian options could be expanded but they offer everything in two portion sizes which is helpful.
".....and justifiably so. A really popular place but great service nonetheless. Terrific food, good value and would go again."
"What a lovely restaurant in St Katherine's Dock. The food was amazing, everything was cooked to perfection & the restaurant itself was lovely & clean. We had a reservation at 8:30pm on a Saturday night, we Arrived early but was seated by the window straight away. The view was beautiful overlooking the docks, boats & pretty lights. The open plan chefs kitchen was nice as you could see the chefs cooking your meals. The toilets were nice & clean & fantastic service from the staff. I will definitely visit again."
Simply fantastic. Great hosts and found my new home from home. Looked forward to the restaurant opening for a number of months and they haven't failed to impress. Michael 10/10.
"We had dinner at this place two times, and I can say that the food is really good. It was quite busy both times so takes a while to get your food but totally worth the waiting. I recommend it to everyone who likes a good steak."
"Having popped in a few times before, we visited The Mitre during a lunch hour and tried the food for the first time. The pub itself maintains a traditional tavern decor, while managing to feel spacious and welcoming. As students, we love that The Mitre offers 20% off all menu items and drinks, making it a great place to stop for lunch or after class! The bar staff are always friendly and helpful, too.We chose the fish finger bap and house burger, both of which came with fries and were both amazing. The only criticism is that there could have been a bit more!"
"This is now our new match day pub for Chelsea, even if it is a bit of a walk to the ground. Great staff, a great range of ales, craft beer and wine and to top it all a brilliant bar snack menu. As there were three of us we ordered three items each off this list and shared them, this really worked as it was more than enough and the brisket and sticky ribs were the stars. Looking forward to their Sunday roast this week before the last game of the season COYB"
Business or pleasure this is a lovely venue for lunch. The food is excellent and the service very good.Can be a bit pricey but if you choose from the set menu then you are on to a winner.
"The 2 ladies in our party ordered Tagliata, sliced steak on a salad. Firstly it was Sirloin and not Fillet which is usually used and secondly, it was very fatty and unappetising. We brought it to the attention of the manager who's only concession was to say he would tell the chef. At over £100 for 3, with just one glass of wine, I expected a more material gesture. It's the last time they'll see me."
"Visited Canary Wharf branch, firstly beer served in a small can and cost over £4.00 ! I had the chilli burger, I like spicy food but the chilli was so hot it killed the whole burger. My partner had a cheese burger, which was OK at best.Our chips were dry and hard with many of them stuck together, I would guess they had been cooked then re-heated or just badly cooked.The whole thing was just poor."
"We like Cote, but this is the first time we have been here. We enjoyed their midweek lunch menu which offers good food at a very reasonable price."
"this restaurant is tucked away in a narrow side street in hampstead and is almost painfully picturesque, a white house as the name suggests, with two tables outside downstairs, a terrace upstairs and a very smart modern interior. we went on a very hot evening in august, and dined early, so we were the 1st folk on the terrace where we could catch what air there was. it was quite funny as the restaurant got busier, as the tables are too close together and we ended up laughing with other eaters as we all had to jiggle about a bit to get fitted in and comfortable.still, it seemed a small price to pay for such a romantic setting, surrounded by flowers.the service is perhaps a little too much like various hushed priests and acolytes serving at a holy mass, but very good, quick and efficient, tailing off just a little as the place grew busier still. my 1st disappointment came as a little amuse bouche - a kind of salsa with a small breadstick in it, was placed on the table and i explained i couldn't eat it as i was on a gluten free diet. the waitress had no clue what i meant and said it only had tomato, garlic and spices in it.at other very good restaurants, ive been so impressed when people have understood immediately AND made efforts to help, even to adjust dishes which happened in the wonderful lodge on loch lomond. i knew i was on my own, but there were quite a few dishes i could eat and i chose artichoke heart and asparagus salad, then risotto with scampi, peas and cherry tomatoes followed by mango sorbet.my husband had lobster soup with crab ravioli parcels and lasagne as a main then pecan pie.my starter was stunningly bland, almost tasteless, and i was hugely disappointed, it had boring old cucumber and big chunks of tomato as well as the main ingredients and some salsiccia. it could have come alive with a delicious dressing, and the usual olive oil and balsamic wasn't enough to resurrect it or even for it to give a twitch.my husband's starter and main he said were both absolutely delicious. he was not so sure about the homemade pecan pie, which was a huge slice blotting out the sun and a little offputting as a result.my main was excellent and made up for the starter, a perfectly creamy risotto with fresh scampi and sweet tomatoes. the mango sorbet was also very good indeed, nice and subtle, and the bottle of pinot grigio to go with the meal crisp, full bodied and clearly top quality from the veneto.we did wait quite a while for the dessert and even on the terrace it was rather too hot for coffee.i'd say the villa bianca is almost perfect but judging by the starter they shouldn't be complacent: i also hope they might take the trouble to find out what a gluten free diet means and be more helpful towards us sufferers"
"Everything was great. Food was really good although they sold it a little too aggressively for my liking. Especially since the food was good, I feel like they didn't need to sell it quite so hard. Abbas and Shohel were quite helpful and friendly, gave us free drinks and discounted food. Would recommend."
"I walked thousands of times around but I never notice it. Somebody talked me really good about it and I decided to try it. It was such a great surprise, in positive way, from the location, to the internal furnishings: it looks to be in a old fashioned sicilian house. The staff was really kind and helpfull. The pizza and the meat was incredible. I loved this pizza, it's not classical napolitan, it's the sicilian way, thicker and more cooked, the one I prefere. The desserts were really good and fresh. We will come back for sure."
"We hadn't booked but managed to find a table at lunchtime, although it was very busy. There was lots of choice on the menu, something for everyone. The food was excellent. The service was smooth and attentive. The atmosphere was lively but we were able to hear ourselves speak."
"Want a loght lunch,good atmosphere,your be happy here.Few issues need fixi g the water taps and the adfing up of dishes...but musy be under pressure. We had a good time although did get over charged.Was an honest mistake.we just had no time to go back ."
"Really rate this restaurant, i have been twice in December, the food is fantastic, service great.I really recommend that you try it you wont be disappointed."
"it was established in 1986. you can notice the name every where in London. It is a unique cafe, in the place you will see the people daily life. Some of them are reading , others are talking or typing on their phones or laptops .nice ambience, delecious food, friendly & quick service.There is a different between eating in and out the place.The hot sandwiched are so tasty. The hot beverages as well. I hope the place does not expand. I believe it has become part of London life.Enjoy your visit and remember me..try to avoid the lunch time , it will be so busy."
"We several friends were looking for an authentic italian restaurant that would also have gluten free pasta. We had not booked and just turned up. The Manager was so accommodating, lovely staff and ambience. Everything we ordered was freshly made there we all had a fab evening. Will definetely go back. Huge selection on vegetarian options. Their pizzas were crispy and genuine italian pizzas. I would recommend to go and have meal it is worth it."
"£20 per bottle of wine on their wine list, looked be about 40 wines to choose from! I'm often a bit of a coward when choosing wine, great to pick what I thought sounded like a lovely wine 'Gorilla Primitiveo' was delicious.We were allowed to have a nose upstairs before leaving. Literally a different world! Very decadent swanky 50s London cocktails bar compared to the romantic French wine bar downstairs."
"Le QuecumBar is a niche market, providing an outlet for live jazz music in the style of the guitarist Django. I have to admit I had never heard of him, but my colleague had wanted to visit this bar/restaurant for years, so I went along.The welcome bellinis were overpriced, and I don't think they had much fizz in them.The menu was interesting, I had squid followed by pork with prunes, both of which were excellent (and huge helpings!). My colleague had a salad starter and the steak, which he said was among the tastiest he had ever had.The live music was very nice, with lots of chat with the small audience, and the welcome but unexpected addition of a double bass player who turned up to join the session.Altogether a pleasant evening, not cheap, but enjoyable. Natalie did a great job serving us, but would have struggled if it had been much busier,The bar is not easy to find, on a back street, not a lot of passing trade I would have thought, we accessed it by bus and a short walk through a housing estate.Would I go back? Probably not, not because I didn't enjoy the evening, but London has so much else to offer. Would I recommend it? Yes, for the experience and the muxic."
"Cheap and cheerful option for a quick meal.The food was a notch or two above Tesco reheat, but the service was very good, and the price was very reasonable for central London. Most importantly, we could find a table for four on a Saturday evening without booking ahead. We were seated on street level, but the place must be huge downstairs. They could accommodate a group of six and another group of seven who were just dropping in."
"Our third or fourth visit to The Antelope, all of which have been fine until today which was shocking.The Roast Beef was tough, clearly cooked in the pan as both sides were the same colour and texture, the Yorkshire Pudding was overcooked and burnt on top, the roast potatoes were under roasted, the gravy was almost non-existent and the carrots were so thin they were burnt.The fish and chips was nothing like in the past, soggy and dull, the chips thin and luke warm.Staff were not attentive and no questions about the amount of food we left on the plate, all in all very poor and we will not return."
"Found this whilst walking around Covent Garden and managed to get an early table. Lovely quirky atmostphere, very relaxing. Staff are friendly and attentive, without being too obtrusive. Nice champagne, to eat, we had the baked Camembert, which was perfect, followed by the champagne and raspberry tiramisu, very moreish! Would definitely visit again"
"From the outside, with people queuing to get in each evening, this place looks like it's going to offer an enjoyable casual dining experience. Not so. Our waitress was totally disinterested in our presence and made no attempt to assist us with the menu - she simply looked at us as though we were a complete hindrance to her evening. We were served semi cold white wine (without the offer of an ice bucket) in hot glasses, when I mentioned it to the waitress she stated defensively that the wine had been in the fridge all day, I explained that the glasses were not helping and finally she offered us glasses from the freezer and a bucket - why not offer this from the beginning? Her attitude towards us soured from simply disinterested to total rudeness after our conversation about the wine. We went on to receive stringy calamari and overcooked fish and horrible dry, hard roast potatoes. Due to the waitress attitude we didn't even bother to mention it.more style than substance - don't waste your time or money"
"Excellent.The Food beautifully cooked, we had unbelievable attentive table service, lovely china plates, sparkling cutlery, Dreamy welcoming Cocktail Faultless."
Visited on a very hot day so in fairness we were missing air conditioning. Line ups for the crowns moved fast enough but once inside the line ups turned into a free for all so not sure what that was about. A must when going to London.
It's what it is!Decent food Good Service at an affordable price!Very buy but service was good with a good portion of food after a long day visiting the attractions. It's a safe option when your unsure
"I am very fond of the Hotel Rafayel and stay there frequently. I hadn't eaten at their restaurant the Banyan on the Thames for two or three years and had previously thought it good value and pretty good food - in the Anglo-Indian fusion style.As I had had a cancellation on a business dinner and wanted an early night, I elected to go there solo for a quick (but not that quick) dinner.Shock number one. The prices! £42 for a steak, really! in a hotel in Battersea?! Worse, Chicken Tikka Marsala £26. Starters averaged in the high £teens and mains in the high £thirties. I see absolutely nothing to justify this level in a very reasonably priced hotel in a backwater of South London.Shock number two. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala as the cheapest thing on the menu that I actually wanted to eat (this has to be the most expensive Tikka in London). It Arrived, Dear Reader, in under a minute. I mentioned to the waiter (not much English) that my chilled out dinner with my Kindle was just about to be done and dusted in under ten minutes and he smiled cheerfully as though I had paid him a great compliment. But it must have been microwaved?, I said. Yes, he smiled and nodded, agreeing with me. Absolutely! Like this is a good thing?? For £26?Shock number three. The food was presented with a bowl of rice and a bowl of curry on a plate. No serving spoons. No garnish of any sort. Nothing to make it look nice or appetizing. The curry itself was hotter than I would have expected for a Tikka Marsala, which was fine, but, oh the salt! Both rice and curry were so heavily salted as to make them almost inedible. I couldn't finish it and spent the night hydrating to get rid of the salty taste.The waiter with limited language skills had no comprehension when I tried to tackle him and wasn't happy when he didn't get a tip. My dinner did indeed last less than 10 minutes and, far from being relaxed and chilled before an early plane in the morning, I left furious and feeling ripped off. And ive left it four days to write this review.I still like the hotel and will continue to stay there but never, ever again will I darken the door of this absolute rip off restaurant.I am very familiar with London restaurants from starred on down. I know what they cost and I know what I should be paying for a given dish in a given style of restaurant. I am not inexperienced in these matters. This was priced so far beyond the norm that it was utterly ridiculous. That the standard of food, presentation and service didn't come close to the pricing only added insult to injury."
"After having looked at the Hispaniola several times but never visited as it seemed to much like a restaurant when that was not what we wanted, we decided to go for a meal on a Sunday lunch time, and we realised we had been totally wrong in our assumption. We sat out on deck with a drink art first - 6th October and very warm and sunny! Then went inside and ordered tapas. We were a little disappointed in that there was not much choice, however what we had we enjoyed and were impressed with the large portions of the various pates which were delicious. The staff were all very friendly and the service was good. The drinks we felt were a bit expensive. Would certainly visit again."
"Requested and were given an a very nice table by the window. When we asked for Melon and Ham for a starter we were told that It was not on the Menu as it was not the right time of the year for good Melons. However we were given a sample taste to make up our own minds which was a nice touch. Not so impressive was when one of our party of 6 complained about the size of her main course pasta which was whisked away ungraciously and then replaced after a considerable delay. The other main courses of lamb shank, lamb cutlets and halibut were all excellent."
Just popped into The Seashell for a very impromptu late lunch today. All 3 of us opted for the express cod and chips menu. The food was delicious - the cod was very flakey with very light batter and the chips were nicely cooked. The portions were just right. The service was excellent. I'd definitely recommend a visit.
"Went there for a Xmas lunch with some mates, ate upstairs and had the fixed Xmas menu. The starter of smoked salmon was miniscule, absolutely miniscule. The main of a traditional turkey dinner was ok although stuffing balls were a bit overcooked. The 'gastro pub' dessert of chocolate mouse with cream was mediocre and all for 39 pounds plus service charge. I don't often leave a restarurant desperate for a McDonalds, but this was one occasion. Service was good though. Well done to the staff for coping with very noisy lunchers."
"... So ... The conversation goes thusly ..Me ""I'll have the Roast Beef and the Cauliflower Cheese side please ?""Him ""Sorry mate, we don't have the Cauliflower Cheese""Me ""So why is it on the menu ?""Him ""We had ten portions earlier, but it's a very popular dish""Me ""Well if it's that popular, why don't you make more of it?""Him ""It's not my problem, you should have got here earlier""Me ""If I'd known you were so bad at Portion Control I would have""Him ""Well, sorry to bruise your ego""Me ""Huh ?"" ... I suggest we leave it there before I bruise more than an ego, good day to you"" I have been drinking in this pub since before that guy was born (or very close to his birth) and I was not at all impressed with his Hipster attitude and couldn't give a toss demeanour. I have lived in Crouch End for 28 years and have seen this pub go through changes recently. I'm pleased for any establishment doing well but ... it needs to remember it's core clientele ... It's also a disgrace when a PUBLIC bar has EVERY table reserved ... Let's hope the hipster gastro pub trend lasts forever .. or they're screwed."
"We were given a Virgin Experience Day as a wedding anniversary present from the children and boy what an afternoon. We Arrived at the hotel lobby and were met by a member of the Virgin Experience Day staff who after checking our tickets showed us to the lift where we were whisked to the 35 floor in next to no time. On exiting the lift we were again met by another female member of the Virgin Experience Day staff who showed us to our table by the window which overlooked Tower Bridge. She remained with us all afternoon seeing to our every need. We were given the menu outlining what we would be having to eat for the afternoon tea and asked to select from the extensive list of what tea we would like to accompany the food. We were asked if anyone had any allergies, my wife has a nut allergy which was duly acknowledged by the member of staff. The afternoon tea Arrived together with a separate plate of gluten free sandwiches for my wife because of her allergy. I have to say that the plate of mixed sandwiches togetherness with the freshly cooked scones and a mixture of cakes were outstanding. However gluten free bread is dry and the texture is very similar to stale bread. My wife pointed this out and in all fairness the staff member immediately took the plate away and replaced it with another one made with fresh bread.We also ordered a bottle of champagne which ended up being complimentary. The view of London from this location is amazing and should be appreciated. The staff and food was outstanding and very much appreciated by the both of us and made the day.Full marks to the Virgin Experience Day staff."
"The food is to be expected for a chain restaurant, and the service does not stand out. We visited as a group of 4, and were seated in a booth - only to be asked to move after a half hour to a smaller table, despite already ordering our drinks and food. Not really sure why this was, as it was a week night and very quiet. Getting the attention of a waitress can be difficult due to the layout of the restaurant - if you're on the raised seating area, you are out of sight of most of the staff and so you have to wait until one comes up to your table. It's not bad, per se, but with so many great independent restaurants in Mill Hill, it would be nice to see Prezzo up their game to keep up with the competition."
"Well only the three of us there for Saturday lunch, 30 minutes to wait for 3 drinks and poppadoms then some confusion over main course. Waiter seemed a bit dim until I spoke to Manager and then thing improved slightly. Could not really understand hold up as only us three there!! Food was delicious when finally and I say finally Arrived!!"
Feel sorry for Arsenal fans paying more on match days and drinking out of plastic glasses. Service is very slow when there's a crowd. Bar closes at 11pm. Avoid if you want a late drink.
"Found this restaurant through tripadvisor and thought it was rated too highly not to try. It's a lovely little authentic restaurant, beautifully decorated with some lovely food. Bread and dips were delicious, although the hot mains weren't as good. Regardless, Liman is great value for money and brilliantly decorated. Would go back."
"We walked to Andover Arms from our place. It was a lovely evening. It was a little tight because it was busy, but there was a fire in the fireplace and it was very cozy. We started with the carrot and horseradish soup. Everyone liked it, I think that it could have used a little more horseradish. I had the fish and chips - it was a huge portion - but very tasty. There were some bones at the end. Two friends had the steak. One ordered it well done and one ordered it medium rare - - they both came out medium/medium well. The other friend had the meat pie and he said it was the best pie he ever had. We had ice creams for dessert. It was hard to understand the waitress because of her foreign accent."
"Food is delicious, CANNOT be faulted, every dish was a delight on the taste buds. HOWEVER, service does let its self down, we unfortunately had to continually ""flag"" down the servers to order extra food and drinks - we also got a little tired waiting for the bill we resorted in upping and heading to the bar so we could pay! Hopefully it's just teething issues."
"Arrived around 5.30 for an early dinner/very late lunch and were seated immediately. My last visit to this TGI's was about 20 years ago and I have fond memories of the food, the service and the ambiance. Pleased to report it is exactly the same. Opted for ribs and they were meaty and succulent. No room for anything else, as TGI's always has big portions. A great place to eat if you need fuel."
"We Arrived very early and the staff couldn't have been more helpful, taking our bags and getting the room ready in super quick time. I was pleased to see that the hotel is exactly as represented, fabulous decor and a lovely ambience. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room had lovely extras (bathrobe, slippers, coffee machine, complimentary water &chocolate). We ate in the pub and the food was delicious. We will definitely be back. Please note that this hotel doesn't have a lift and has lots of stairs so is not suitable for those with mobility issues."
"A bustling but well organised environment. Great service and extremely child friendly. Great children menu- really appetising, fresh produce for my two fussy eaters- the sausage lollipop was a hit. Our pizza and salmon dish was superb. Allowed to eat great food and absorb the environment of Covent Garden - pucka!"
"Last Tuesday my wife, son and his wife and I visited this restaurant using Groupon vouchers. We had a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The staff were excellent and the food and wine was also excellent. We were entitled to a free glass of wine with our meal and the red wine we had was so good we ordered a bottle. We all agreed we would thoroughly recommend this restaurant to anyone."
It was an experience that a friend of mine wanted to enjoy. She actually won some money. I found the place a bit seedy. It was well maintained but the general atmosphere was a place that was more like a men's club as I did not see many women there. A lot of smoke and late night atmostphere.
"Open to the marketplace but with foot and overhead heaters in case of chilly weather, this casual restaurant is a nice stop for lunch. Unlike a previous reviewer, I had the Woodsman pizza and really liked it. The mushrooms had good flavor but were just criminis , nothing exotic or interesting. The bangers and mash that hubs had was fairly ordinary, but well executed. Yeah, a little pricey for what you get. Good service. Good people watching. No regrets."
The concept at cicchetti is sharing food and this way you can order a good selection and try out quite a bit on the menu. The dishes were all lovely and the price was reasonable too.
"The food here was absolutely delicious - you can tell as soon as you see & taste it that it is authentic. Staff are very friendly & polite, I think it is family run. Food was served piping hot & a good selection of relish to go with the food.It would be good if the menu had a bit more choice but maybe they change the menu regularly.They have a good happy hour for cocktails and also a food happy hour/special offers before 7pm.Would definitely recommend."
"My local is the one on Long Acre, in Covent Garden, but I have also been known to frequent others in the area - and in New York. The food is good, the service is mostly friendly.I'll often bring in my own fresh berries to add to the porridge or muesli for breakfast. For my lunch taste, the soups and sandwiches are just made for each other. And after the theatre, I like the sweet (but healthy!) blueberry probiotic yoghurt way to end the day..This chain has several competitors but so far, I keep going back to Pret."
Such a cozy little place. This was our second time eating here and it instantly became our favourite place in London after our first visit there. It's the perfect place for a romantic date or for the whole family to visit. We experienced both. We ordered a big selection of tapas which we enjoyed with a bottle of Bourdon. We got shots on the house which was a great surprise as well. The food is outstanding and so is the service. We will definitely go here every time we visit London.
"We have been to many Gaucho but must say Mark and his staff made our day. I have been very ill recently, but they made us feel very special the food was excellent. Thank you so much"
"Food was fine - we had the special which was mackerel and a seafood pasta dish. The service was very good but best of all was Holts Crystal lager on draught! Nice enough restaurant - furniture a bit like an Ikea kitchen and quite noisy due to time of day and families with young children. Overall, it was worth what we paid."
Best Italian ive ever hadQuite simply this is the best Italian food ive ever had. And probably the best food full stop......-Stunning food-Excellent value-Attentive and friendly staff-Great surroundings and atmosphere
"We went at Bar Boulud for lunch and chose the 3 course menu for 22 pounds. It were fantastic. The quality, taste, presentation, staff, wine list, ambience, everythig was perfect.If you go once, you will, for sure, come back."
"Wanting a nicer lunch than American Airlines was going to give me on a flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia, I did what I usually do, which was to treat myself to some tasty food at Caviar House. Had a half lobster (frankly not worth the £29.50, though tasty enough) and a plate of Balik salmon and shrimps (£27) which is much better value for money. Had a half bottle carafe of an adequate Sauvignon Blanc for £21.50. Pricey for what you get, but in the circumstances the best food option ive discovered at Heathrow. Service is swiftÓalmost no cooking is done on the spot. Considering Heathrow's numerous and not very appetizing options, Caviar House continues to be my choice. Certainly beats what American Airlines is going to offer you."
"After visiting many TGI's and some not being great but always returned as I like the food and the atmosphere there, this however was by far the best outlet for the company I have been too! The bar service was fast even though the bartender was servicing about four different groups at the same time, very impressed with the speed and service, not long after we were called to our table and seated, we were being looked after by Liam. Throughout our meal he was always checking if everything was ok, keeping the drinks topped up and all the staff kept the table clear after each course. Very impressed with the visit and something a few restaurants within the group could learn from, will be visiting again soon, keep up the great service!!!"
the staff was lovely and very friendly however the fries were served to us burnt and we were over charged by mistake on our bill by over £35! on a meal for 2! it was our second visit there not sure we will be back the service charge on each item is a little cheeky also.
"Four of us went to celebrate a birthday.We went on a Saturday night and it was very busy.We had booked weeks in advance and so should you.It is a small place but beautifully organised and run.All the staff who dealt with us were personable,knowledgeible and attentive.The food was excellent and served as required.Nothing was rushed and there was a great willingness to accommodate tastes and requests.A vibrant atmosphere and ambiance but not noisy or intrusive.We loved it and will go again."
"Decent enough place, very reasonably priced and food was quite tasty.We had 5 dishes which was enough, only one dish disappointed slightly. It was £40 for 2 with drinks included"
"I have eaten at Elliot's twice before and recommend it loads, usually people can't get in. Anyway I was in the area and struck luck again. The food was delicious, I had hake and my friend, a real foodie who has eaten in some amazing restaurants, had the onglet. She was blown away by the food as it sets your tastebuds zinging, with the combinations of ingredients bringing out the flavour of every item being eaten. To top it all I left a small bag with some cards in at the table and the waiter chased us with the bag. Many thanks Elliot's and we will be back."
"Like the fillings, fresh and quite tasty on the whole. I often go to one when I am in the city, often the one on Queensway.A bit expensive for some things but on the whole theyre good."
Went for lunch on the special offer of £35 each including a glass of bubbles and was amazed at the choices on the menu. A great choice of food and deliciously cooked and I will definitely be visiting here again.
"Go early it gets crowded. What a fun entertaining resturant. You can watch through the glass and see the entertainment at Covent Square. I ordered pizza and a salad, but the burgers looked amazing. Great food and fun."
"Peking Duck crispy skin moist meat not dried out, chicken and vegetable dumplings great, eggplant and minced chicken great, fried rice great also. Quick friendly service great food , Peking Duck a standout a pleasure to eat here highly recommended."
Had excellent meal here. Wonderful lamb covered hummus. Tasty haloumi. Great breads. Mixed grill was delicious. Service was attentive. £67.95 for two including drinks and an 'optional' service charge.
We booked for lunch on Saturday and everyone in our party aged from 9 to 80 enjoyed a wonderful meal. The atmosphere is relaxed and the staff very friendly and attentive. Our party ordered 5 different main course dishes and every one was superb. Desserts didn't disappoint either. Pimms on the open deck in the sunshine before lunch was a real treat too. After lunch we took a cruise on the river Thames from Westminster Pier with City Cruises - great way to end the day!
"Came here on a whim with 2 friends. Had to wait a few mins for a table, but it was 1230 on a Sunday so not unreasonable. Good wholesome pizza with excellent quality ingredients. Very reasonable prices, and friendly staff. My only criticism is the menu, which is reassuringly short, but slightly unclear and over-complicated. I also couldn't really read the writing of the specials on the blackboard. That aside, very pleasant."
"I visited here last night while meeting some friends and my first impression was that the restaurant looked like it should be a NY deli instead of an Italian restaurant so I was a little unsure of what to expect. Let me tell, looks can be and re deceiveing here. The food was Amazing! One of their popular dishes is the Spaghetti Bolognese so I asked them to switch it up a bit and make it With their Rigatoni noodles instead of spaghetti. So basically a Rigatoni Bolognese with extra mozzarella Cheese added on top. It was phenomenal!! Best dish ive ever had in London. It was so good and looked so good when it Arrived at my seat that another customer tapped me on the shoulder and asked me what I ordered because he said it looked so good that he wanted it to. He was also very pleased with this order I created so who knows maybe they should add it to the dish for good. If it's not there when you get there, ask them to make it! You won't be sorry."
"We stumbled across this excellent little pub whilst sheltering from the rain. The football was on so we stayed a while & discovered friendly staff, a fab range of drinks and though we didn't eat here the food looked & smelled lovely! I'm sure we will be back :-)"
"This would have been a higher score if not for the extremely slow service we received during our meal. Although friendly, our waiter was forgetful and so so slow! We understood completely that it was extremely busy but to receive items to accompany a meal when you've already finished isn't helpful! Food was good, drinks okay."
"The atmosphere of this place was very nice, but extremely loud as we went at night. If you order the typical fish and chips, beware that it will be a really big fish, so plan ahead or consider sharing, especially if you order appetizers too. Enjoy."
We visited Tanner & co this morning and had a great brunch. The staff were extremely friendly and the food was very tasty. No hesitation in returning!!
Took some out of town friends here for lunch.....I ordered a steak to be cooked 'medium' and after two bites I discovered it was VERY rare and tough!! I told the waitress and she mentioned it to her manager who didn't have the courtesy to come over himself and sent a message back to us saying there was nothing he would do as I had already taken a bite!We couldn't believe how discourteous and uncaring they were!! Won't set foot in this place again.Lots of other options for eating in this area - I would strongly suggest you go elsewhere.
Really nice atmosphere and friendly helpful staff. Great for a light lunch or something more substantial. Very reasonably priced for the location and good range of beers
"I came here last night with my boyfriend and 2 other couples to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. Beautiful place, Theo the bartender is a credit to your bar. Amazing cocktails and service..absolutely fantastic..we will definitely come here again."
I went to a Mayoral charity ball in the Harris Suite of Chelse FC with catering by Marco. The Beef Fillet was generous in proportion and cooked perfectly (as compared with thin and well-done fillet the day before at Waterside Inn). A tasty cut as well. Dessert was an el-Bulli-esque ball of mango/passionfruit that was delightful. Starter was a fairly ordinary tart/quiche. On the basis of this I'll give the restaurant proper a go soon.
"Tom is a fast-talking, character-filled gentleman who makes the best pie I have ever had! We came back two nights because we just coulsnt get enough. The lamb shanks were excellent but the chicken and ham pie is something I will dream about!"
very interesting variety of food at reasonable prices. Especially liked the wraps
"I was treated to dinner at the Park Terrace this Valentines Day and it was an absolute delight. Their Valentines Day Set Menu was fantastic - my boyfriend went so far as to say it was the best dessert he'd ever had in his life. The restaurant itself it beautiful and elegant and all of the staff were lovely, our waiter in particular.It's definitely at the ""special occasion"" end of the restaurant spectrum, but I would heartily recommend."
"I was due to meet a friend i had not met for a long time and wanted a central pub with a separated dining room. After a quick hunt on line I found the Lamb and Flag and was presently surprised how easy and flexible the system was to book a table. So often you can be restricted to fixed timeframes which rarely fit your requirements. This did and I was sent a flexible reminder the day before. We Arrived early for our reservation, and after a drink in the bar were welcomed upstairs to our reserved table, still before the booked time. It was surprisingly quiet, which suited us. We ordered a main and then a pudding: fish and chips and best steak and chips: standard pub food. Everything was fine and the waitress helpful without pressuring us. We followed this with sticky toffee pudding and crumble. This was a busy meeting with lots of conversation whilst we ate. Disappointingly, despite having good fish and an excellent perfectly cooked tender steak, the chips were tepid and some were crispy and hard. There was no custard for the crumble as advertised and just ice cream was offered. Now you would think that with a limited menu, there are basics you need to get right. It was not busy and if you cook chips, don't let them sit around for too long- bin them and cook more. And finally, how long does it take to make some custard? So a couple of disappointments there sadly which the pub can easily pick up on.I liked the location and the full supply of beers downstairs. We had an excellent Malbec with our meal. Did it tick all the boxes for lunch in Covent Garden where you could hear yourself speak? Yes it did, but there is room for improvement. Owners need to remember that all their clientele are not tourists and know their chips and custard. I am confident that these small blips are easily resolved for the greater benefit of all. Would I return? Yes."
"The food was simply delicious, each plate was a very different and unique experience and the staff very professional, very smart and are very helpful and friendly. . I will definitely be returning."
"Nice pub with big tables, so you might end up sharing....in was quiet when we popped in. Popped in for an early (ish) dinner and a pint. Let's start with the beer, the London Pride was to die for. One of the best pints of it I have ever had (and I have had a few!).The menu was a bit limited, and a burger and chips was a little over £11.00, but have it we did. It was very good, not sure about very good value, and served on a tray, with chips in a metal mug....what ever happened to the good old fashioned plate?? Anyway, nothing wrong with the food (maybe for the money not quite enough of it but then this is trendy Greenwich) but well done on the beer....I would go back just for that!!!"
"We stumbled into this place during our last visit and ended up eating at one the the many Pret a Manger several times. The soup is delicious and the fresh fresh sandwiches were delicious. Price was reasonable and popular amongst the locals, too."
"Tucked down Blandford Street, just opposite where Marylebone Lane joins Marylebone High Street, sits Fairuz, a small, friendly Lebanese restaurant.We opted for the set menu, which was a mixed bag; the starters were delicious and filling. The main meat course was however a little disappointing and much less flavourful and authentic than the first course.For a light meal, the starter mezzo plates are probably filling enough.Both the Lebanese beer and Rose wine were delicious.Warm and friendly staff and service throughout the meal.About £45 per head for the set dinner and drinks, including VAT and service, fixed at 12.5%."
"This is a restaurant deserving of an amateur write up. A simple menu with the finest seasonal ingredients. As far as flavour goes, some of the best food I have ever had! The steak was amazing, as were the other dishes my friends had. Hidden away in Central London this is a unassuming restaurant that also has a fantastic wine list that is extremely affordable. Not a restaurant for a gastro snob, just one for those of us who know about and love their food. Great staff as well!"
"I have to say that I'm actually quite astounded by how good our experience of the 68 and Boston was last night.Tasked with finding a bar in Soho, I came across 68. I looked at a few pictures, thought it looked nice enough, and booked. I just assumed it would be your average kind of wine bar, but I was very wrong.Upon arriveal, the door was opened by a door staff member who was very friendly and gave great banter. We were shown to our table, and were already impressed with the decor / atmosphere inside. It got even better from there. Every bottle of wine was £20 (bargain), but they were good quality wines that the waitress even allowed us to sample a few of (this led to us staying for 2 bottles even though we'd originally planned to go somewhere else). On that note, Josie deserves a mention...she was incredibly friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the products. The charcuterie board was very good, and everyone there seemed to take great pride in working for a good establishment.I highly recommend this place, and will certainly be telling friends, and visiting again."
"If you like toasties or grilled cheese sandwiches this is the place for you. It won't knock your socks off but it is delicious,"
Lovely place with incredible view. I had avocado and poached egg and it was very good . Portion are big . Price are good. I will definitely come back often.
"I found out his gem on my first day and have been back for a lovely breakfast each day. The staff are welcoming and attentive. The breakfasts are simple and delicious. The owner, Joe, is the perfect host."
"Getting a reservation first by calling wasn't ideal as they didn't put my arriveal on the system - and clearly we tried calling only to find out that the actual ppl you speak with are not at the restaurant or even on site. Eventually the two ladies at the entrance b4 the elevators decided to take my reservation - which they should have suggested 15 mins earlier instead of all of us wasting time calling around.Service once upstairs was very good. Food options were rather limited so would recommend more standard choices or options. Added bonus being able to walk around after made it worthwhile. Items are pricey but expected given the location.Overall, need to improve the reso plus security entrance process. The views are worth the visit alone."
"We happened across Tothello when we stayed just round the corner and what a great find. Friendly welcoming staff, a light and airy atmosphere and exceptional Greek pies and pastries."
"We've used this great restaurant many times and today was for a great late lunch. We've tried the main courses, but today we went for A selection of tapas. Great fun, great food and great service. As you may have realised by now, the word for this restaurant is GREAT."
Great service. Lovely food. Did not seem like a chain restaurant at all. Ended up there quite by chance since traffic into London was heavy.
"My daughter really wanted to try Yorkshire pudding while in London and this lovely place came up. It did not disappoint! The four of us started our meal with a delicious soup of the day, I had the warm country salad-amazing! We shared a couple plates of the savory puddings, which came in three flavors; Light crust and just yummy. We also tried the lamb; just incredible, not a huge portion but melted in the mouth with great spices. This left us with just enough room to try the sweet yorkshires: light and delicious, not heavy. Would love to go back and try more of menu. The service was great, very friendly and attentive. Oh and a great drink menu as mentioned in other posts. For a great restaurant in a chic neighborhood it was a great value too!"
"Regular diners here, the food is always good, the wait staff are efficient and charming and we always have a great time. The only thing is it is noisy at night and it is better to sit in the main room. All in all a very good restaurant."
"Have had a great few visits to 'Reform' over the past few months, this place is a very well kept secret, with most of the pubs and bars usually packed and over-priced in the area 'Reform' is a fantastic place to eat, drink and meet friends. The location is superb (only a few minutes walk from Selfridges!) so is really handy when I had parents visiting from out of town.My dad loved eating the mini-Yorkshire puddings that we had read about in the newspaper about, and my gran had a great chat with the manager (Scottish guy called James I think, was genuinely helpful when explaining the menu to her). The desserts that we had were a stand-out and all washed down with some espresso martinis - on the three occasions I have been there is always a decent promotion on.I would say if you are meeting friends in central London, seek out Reform as its great value in a perfect London location which no-one seems to know about...yet!"
"It was a nice sunny evening, we were walking through Covent Garden and decided to try Jamie's UNion Jacks. Now I am a fan of Jamie so was expecting something nice. We both ordered fish and chips and a beer each. Before we blinked, the food Arrived. We were served the most greasy oily,inedible batter I have ever seen when I pushed my fork into it, oil literally dripped out of it into a pool on the plate. This greasy fish was sitting on top of half a dozen what I can only describe as excuses for chips, the mushy peas were cold and the tartare, if that's what it was, was tasteless and oily. NOT RECOMMENDED & NEVER AGAIN"
"This is a typical old British Pub, Ideal for tourists to get a experience, We were made welcome and served very quickly, the pub was very busy. We had shorts and personally were not to our taste, however they were very cheap compared to other establishments nearby, I personally think this would be more of a barrel a bitter pub as it is obviously linked to the brewery. We would visit again, but possibly try the cask beers, toilets were clean and food looked good"
"this is one of the best pizza i have had in london , , lovely service and very good prices , will be back soon."
"On the go, Pret a Manager worked well for us. Its grab and go. We were in and out quickly. Nice touch: they warmed our sandwiches for us."
"I visited here with my friend and had the taster menu. The wine perfectly complimented the food and the service was great! I highly recommend the seabass to start and the lamb shank for main. These were very very tasty and the bread that came with was delicious. The mango sorbet was fantastic.There's not much of an atmosphere, it's very quiet but the food was the tastiest Indian food ive ever had however slightly over priced."
"Overall a most enjoyable event. The ship has a great setting, with excellent views across the Thames. We ran on the Spring Set Menu for 27 Pounds. The Manager was helpful in arranging the seating plan in advance. The staff were helpful and polite.The menu was good with one exception. Many of us ordered the Smoked Mackerel Mousse; sadly, there was very little Mousse; it was padded with lots of vegetables. Given that smoked mackerel is not expensive, I feel that could have provided a much better starter. Having said that; the rest was very good. There must be a special mention for the crumble, which comes in its own small pot - totally delicious !"
"We popped into Belushis bar after a long day of site seeing and shopping, 2 adults 2 teenagers and a 12yr old, touched lucky and got a table near the window, bar was busy but not crowded and bar service really quick. Happy hour meant bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for a tender - thought it would be dodgy but better than some ive tasted in expensive restaurants. Kids ordered Nachos Grande and fries and where not disappointed the Nachos were fab and served really nicely. Generally all food served looked lovely. Would definately recommend this bar we where pleasantly surprised at the low prices in the heart of London."
"We came here before the theatre one evening. We selected this place simply out of convenience because we knew it was close, plus I had eaten here a few years ago and remember it being an OK place to have dinner.Our meal was largely forgettable and the service was borderline awful. Our two reasonably priced draught beers took so long to come out, we were sure she had forgotten them. The pasta wasn't too bad except our request for cheese apparently was a bit of a big deal for the server. And lastly, our pizza that advertised bay leaves came out with one (see picture).Really, this was a fairly average experience that makes me never want to go back. It is a chain and therefore nothing too original is on the menu but I still hoped we'd have a nice Italian dinner out. For such an average place, there are many more places to try in the area without devoting your business to this one."
"Although the food standard in general is good, we encountered quite a few issues with our experience in general. We ordered onion rings with our meal, and as they did not come out with everything else we asked where they were only to be told they didn't have any left, we would have appreciated being told this by a member of staff! following this a table behind us then received a meal with onion rings on even though he ordered after us, we also find it slightly ridiculous that you then have to pay forchips as extra with your steak when the steak is already rather expensive! we also would have appreciated being told that the water we asked for was also being charged as we expected this to be free particularly as it was not even cold, lastly we also found it unusual that there was a cover charge that we were also not made aware of"
"I took a party of six on Saturday night to The Maynard Arms in Crouch End,I think it only fair to state that I am a restauranteur of some 35 years.I fully appreciate that some pubs that offer food have a much more relaxed way of service than many restaurants,but this pub was totally amateurish.When we sat down our waitress just plonked down six menus on the middle of the table,there was no hallo or any sought of welcome.We waited ages to order drinks,even thought it was only 7.30pm and they where very quite.When we started to order our food we had one or two questions for the waitress,each time she answered "" it's a new menu I will have to find out "".We ordered a whole baked Camembert with toasted Ciabatta bread to start,which at £14 is not cheap,when it Arrived it was stone cold,and was served with three thin slices of cold Ciabatta toast.We sent it back asking for it to be reheated and for some more toast ( please remember there where six of us) When it came back it wasn't much hotter and the chef just sent out some extra cold brown bead.We also ordered some olives, these finally turned up after requesting them four times.When they eventually served our main course,I had ordered the Crouch End burger,which was meant to have two patties,I received one, when I told the waitress she told me that's all the chef had left !! One of my guests had ordered a rump steak,this was served when the rest of the party had finished eating there mains.I really thought that when I asked for the bill that they would all considered remove the 12.5% service charge ( about £19 ) but of course it was still on the bill.As I was entertaining friends I did not want to make a fuss or further ruin the evening,but I will telephone the manager today ( Sunday).In summing up this review,I can only say that this is one of the worst dinning out experiences that ive had in the last twenty years and I gave them one star as there is not an option on this site to give NO stars which would have better reflected my dinning experience at this establishment."
"I came here with my boyfriend for a late lunch after walking around London. The staff were not helpful and when I asked about certain gluten-free options they didn't offer any information. The food was nice although my boyfriend wasn't asked what sauce he wanted with his steak and they then charged us for changing the sauce. We also ordered a vanilla milkshake which took about 15 minutes to come and was luke-warm when we received it. None of the staff did a check back when we had our food. When we were ready to pay the bill nobody came over to check we were finished so my boyfriend had to go inside to get one of the waitresses attention and ask for it. After we had received the bill, I was ready to pay with my card but the waitress didn't seem very interested in coming over to take payment. She sighed and said she'd be with us in a moment and came back 5 minutes later with the card machine. Throughout the whole meal, the staff were not attentive and didn't seem bothered about good service. This was my first trip to bella italia and I was originally excited to see that they had so many gluten-free options available but the customer service was bad which unfortunately, did not make my first visit a good one."
"Nice family run Italian, passed on from father to his 2 sons. The family also used to run The Wine Press on Fleet Street before its lease came to an end. This is a nice spot tucked away in the basement of a large office building in the middle of the legal quarter (just outside the Temple). Excellent thin crust pizzas, nice pasta and usually a good range of fresh daily specials. Great and reasonably priced place for a swift, no fuss and informal lunch."
Very good food. We stopped in randomly and tried it out. I had the spaghetti and meatballs dish which was very good. I would definitely recommend!
"A great variety of vegan, GF and vegetarian options - all which tasted incredible. Pricing is a bit steep but you pay by weight so it can be a bit hard to estimate how much you are spending (especially with everything looking so good!)."
Nothing like the explosion of taste you get in Bangkok Nice decor and staff but would not go again The place was busy but certainly did not live up to expectation
"This restaurant has changed my mind about English cooking. Good food in a charming and warm environment, and not very expensive, being one of the oldest restaurants in London."
One time this was a good restaurant to have fish and chips. I was very disappointed with the poor service and quality of the food. Arrived last Friday around 6.15 without a reservation with and elderly lady. Was told at reception since we did not have booking we need to leave by 7.30. It took 20 minutes just to order drinks and to get a menu baring in mind they asked to leave by 7.30. My guest was already getting distressed as she was 92 years old and the restaurant empty more than half. My guest ordered cod and chips I ordered scampi and chips. Asked if the scampi was fresh yes they said but was frozen. The Hungarian waitresses kill the place with no understanding service. Once we finished we asked if there was any fruit . Was told no. I called the manager if it would be possible to have just a scoope of ice cream with few strawberries. She was very kind and organised it . This was the highlight of the evening. I will stick to my North Sea Fish where the service is good and the fish excellent.
"great menu, good choices with good taste food, will go again. the menu was varied and a little different with some good options beside chicken. Service was very good and the restaurant was clean"
"I really liked the atmosphere of the place - dim lights, community-style tables, the smell of incense wafting through the air to supposedly transport you (in spirit) to Thailand... The menu is pretty extensive, and there are loads of nice-looking things to try. My boyfriend and I ordered the 'special' pad thai (forgot what it's called), seabass, crispy squid and fried chicken. Overall, the food was good but nothing to shout about. I will say that it was better than I expected as Busaba is a very 'British-ized' Thai chain in my opinion, so I didn't think it would be very authentic. It wasn't the best Thai food, but that would be asking too much. It can be very pricey if you want to try many different dishes!Oh, I will say that the squid was VERY good though. If there is any reason to return, it would be for that! Otherwise, like other reviews say, I wouldn't return in a hurry."
Went on a weekend after a Spurs game - was freezing and starving - could not have chosen a better place! The sunday roast is delicious. Eat either in the bar or in the cosy restaurant. Wine list is fab (on a blackboard) and extensive.Decor is great; all in all a favourite pub.
"Its a very good price-food quality relationship. The only thing form me, not knowing this part of London is that it was difficult to find."
"Adult night out with family. Food was delicious and the staff very helpful and patient with all the menu changes and special requests we asked for. Very comfortable, relaxing atmosphere in the heart of Hampstead. Would visit again."
"Nicely located and easy to find from Embankment tube. It has a small menu but the food was nice and the service excellent. One small issue is that if you are eating from the restaurant menu you are supposed to sit inside, however we made a fuss and they served outside on the open deck. This place makes a nice difference from all those tourist trap places in London."
"Myself and two friends decided to sample this restaurant having been recommended it before. We all had starter, mains and desert which were all amazing, the steak was cooked to perfection and the chicken was very tender and not dry like I have had in other restaurants. The service was great and the chef even came out to see us which was a great touch. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone, its hidden away at Stamford Bridge but the transport options are great so don't let this put you off."
"I like the changes that have been made to this tapas restaurant, it has more of a local spanish tapas feel to it now and I was impressed to see it so busy when we popped in on a Monday night. The food was as good as always and it was lovely to see a number of special dishes available including a special wine list."
Gaucho has got to be one of my all time favourite places to eat and enjoy the atmosphere.The staff are always friendly and willing to go that extra mile
"having had a series of disappointing visits to Charlotte's I visited again 2 weeks ago, during day time. The manger went out of his way to apologise and both service and food were great, this time."
"A quick meal and drinkies prior to going the cinema , we love it at Busabas , the thai calamari is a taste sensation to die for , i had the iconic 2 chilli coconut milk curry , perfect in presentation , unique taste with the chilli heat level right on the money, loved it"
"Chef's table: quite frankly extraordinary.Wonderful personal service from Jesse, the chef, who spent the evening delivery course after course of delicious and exciting delicacies and providing wonderfully entertaining commentary to accompany them.The most exciting elements I won't share - that would ruin the surprise, which is half the fun. But suffice to say that this is an experience you don't want to miss out on - a festiveal of all of the senses!Relatively pricey for a miser like me but worth it for a special celebration. Just don't eat during the preceding week and make sure that you don't have anything strenuously planned for the following day..."
We came here as a little treat to ourselves and were very happy after our evening. We got a very warm welcome and a seat right by the river (looking at the eye) which is a bonus!We had the Set menu which was very tasty! The smoked chicken was particularly tasty and the pork belly was so nice! Good desserts too!To be honest...The portions for myself (quite a greedy person) were just about right! Although I would of loved some more! I would recommend to a friend...although my final suggestion would be to go on a weekend or Friday night. It was quite deserted which is a shame.
"This was our first visit and as a result of reviews. We were not disappointed. From the moment we stepped through their door, we were made welcome, comfortable and wonderfully fed. It has that amazing Italian family atmosphere of warmth, caring, impeccable service, traditional and modern food of the very best from Italy. Brilliant evening - we will be back!"
Very cozy. Food was very good - try the French Onion soap which was an excellent starter on a bit chilly evening in London. An interesting menu with many choices and at an affordable price. CÌ«te gets my compliments for their fine service and good French inspired food
"Great breakfast. Popped in here a couple of mornings when staying at the nearby Intercontinental Hotel. Thought the breakfast was great, loved the little twists like chilli jam on the bacon sandwich."
"I met a friend at Polpo Smithfields for a mid-week dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We had to wait almost an hour for a table, which we were happy to spend sipping on cocktails in the downstairs ""Negroni Bar"". The plates we ordered, for sharing, were all excellent, with the pork belly with radicchio and hazelnuts being the real highlight. The atmosphere was buzzing and the service was efficient. This has been one of the better London restaurants ive discovered in my first two months spent liveing in London. I plan to return."
We just spent two weeks in Paris and London and chez Patrick had to be one of the best restaurants we ate at. The cozy restaurant serves incredibly excellent french cuisine. We had the chicken with tarragon sauce and it was to die for. The restaurant is small so reservations are recommended.
"I went here with a client one evening. It is located downstairs on the corner of London Wall and Blomfield St. I have been here a couple of times before and the food is good, although I am not a lover of Thai food in general. As it is downstairs it can feel a bit dark, which is OK if you are on a date. It wasn't that busy, that evening. We started off with some beers and a few starters. I enjoyed the satay chicken and the chilli squid, but was not fussed about the fish cakes (but I am not a lover of fish). For my main meal I went for chicken with cashews and some plain rice, which was very nice. The staff were attentive and the meal reasonable value."
Fantastic pub just across the road from the infamous and very mundane Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel. The White Hart brews it's beer under the street and had a fantastic selection if ale and some good pub grub. definitely worth a visit. Attracts a great mix of people and feels safe... which you can't say for a lot of this area. Order food early as if busy they stop serving.
"We got a voucher for half price of the Burlesque Show and a three course meal, so myself and the missus headed to Layalina's basement restaurant on a Thursday evening. The ordinary price is £51 per person to watch the show and have a three course meal, but with the voucher we got half price of this.The food left quite a lot to be desired, the set menu means you get mere for starter, this was actually OK, but did not taste like it had been prepared freshly, but had been sitting in the fridge for a few days. There are only two choices for main, so we both had the chicken and rice, which was cold and way too little. The baklava for dessert was also very small.The Burlesque Show was really nice though, and it was a bit interactive which was fun. The room was less than half full, and it was mainly couples and a few pairs of girls there. The restaurant is aimed mainly at couples on a date.When the bill came, there was a 30% service charge added to it. This had not been stated on the menu, nor on the voucher we had, which is borderline fraudulent. We were told that this was to pay for the show, but we had understood that the show was included in paying for the meal. This is very unprofessional of the restaurant's management."
"Great food, great beer, great price, great fun. Really nice traditional food, tasty and nicely cooked. Recommended if you don't like pretentious eateries."
"We had Leggera Pollo ad Astra pizza and I can absolutely recommend it! However be ware their pizza's are slightly smaller size than average pizzas plus ours had a hole in the center that was filled with salad, so do order some side-dishes with it. Not the cheapest pizzeria out there, but definitely very good. P.S. Take-out takes ages!"
"Went here on my lunch hour from work to get a take away Phad Thai. Placed our order, sat down and waited. 25 minutes later we were still sat their waiting. I asked the waitress if she could check what the delay was. She said she would check, She went over to the lift where they send the food down and produced my take away Phad Thai from the liftHowever they forgot the second Phad Thai we ordered. We were left sitting for another 10 minutes by which time my Phad Thai had gone cold and they still didnt know what the delay was or give us any reason for not having the second one. Over a 30 minute wait for 2 take away Phad Thai's at 12:30 in the afternoon. Another 2 customers got up and walked out as they were also on their lunch break and their food hadn't Arrived by the time they had to go back to the office. From the other reviews on here is seems to be on ongoing issue. An absolute joke of a set up. Whoever is in charge of this place clearly doesn't have a clue on how to run a kitchen in a busy period. Definitely wont be returning."
"Great night - cocktails in the bar, then dinner - fois gras, smoked salmon, guinea fowl caesar salad. Then Grouse ( oh yes !) and steak to share. Excellent meat and grouse. Onto puds - coffee ice cream, sticky toffee pudding - yum. Had a Chilean red ( 2 bottles) and a french white. Loved the purple Duchess cocktail.Food good and flavourful. Could use a little work on the veg and the Grouse trimmings seem depleted from last year. So much steak left over we had roast beef sandwiches for lunch today. Nice easy to carry box to bring it home in. Like the 50cl white carafe as a boot up from a half bottle which is never quite enough somehow. Miss the nibbles which seem to have gone from the cocktail bar. The staff were very good as one of our guests got stuck on a broken train and we had to push dinner back. Great night out - total bill £500 for 6."
One of the oldest (if not the oldest) restaurants in London serving English fare ... Walk into Rules and you are transformed to a country manor's dining hall with the Decor and the stuffed animals' heads... The fare is superb with many classics to die for... the fowl & game are mostly sourced from their own reserves in the countryside. the service : impeccable and attentive... I always leave 'Fully' satisfied..
The ones near where I work in the City are good. The food is fresh and quite good for calories and the staff are very friendly.
"We went here specifically to try the Sunday Roast yesterday after walking the dog. The beef was like leather and the potatoes had not been peeled or roasted, just unpeeled half cooked and peas and courgettes (who serves peas and courgettes with roast beef) were barely blanched. The yorkshire pudding was at least home made. Unfortunately it was so bad we had to send it back as it was inedible. Note to the chef. Please take a walk down Lordship Lane to the Palmerston and see how it's done! Roast is not rocket science, why is it SO hard to find a decent one in South London."
"We enjoyed a quiet, but very relaxing mid-week dinner. The service was great and very efficient, and the menu was extensive with mouthwatering choice for all. Being close to Liverpool Street is a great advantage for after work diners, although we travelled up from Essex and Kent and it was a great mid-way meeting point and worth the effort. The cold drinks seemed watered down, but the wine and food was excellent."
We had a party for 30 odd friends and were very well looked after by the Lord Palmerston team. They prepared the upstairs room set with tables so we could sample their fab food and lit the room with candles creatimg a warm and lovely atmosphere - a fine time was had by all.
Fish Arrived late with a solid lump of stone cold mash underneath. Sent back followed by further long wait before food came back hot this time. They knocked a dessert and coffee off bill but won't ever be going back. Really poor.
"Went after work (round the corner ) and was deciding between rosa or here...chose here....bad mistake. Service at the start was good- wine ordered and ready to go. Took a good 15 minutes until we then ordered and when the food came was not impressed. Tasteless, no seasoning and very bland. For this type of cuisine it is begging for some taste..unfortunately not. We ordered the special prawn wonton (burnt) and salt & pepper prawns (underdone), crispy chilli beef (not crispy but flaccid) and Katsu (tasteless, no heat) with steamed rice (tasteless). There was not enough staff so we waited for the bill for ages and did not have a chance to complain. We saw people having to stand up and seek out staff to get an order, in the end we took our bill to the bar to pay and was asked 'how was you meal' our response was 'not great' , no answer to that and staff walked off..and £60 later are very disappointed...basically cheap tasteless food for mass tourists, will NOT be going back."
Fab cocktail menu and lovely ambience. The bar has all been restored to be sympathetic with the building's and looks really great.
"Went for a late dinner and drinks with 3 friends last Saturday evening. Were told there would be an hour and a half wait although 3 quarters of the restaurant was empty (on a summer saturday evening?!). Chose to have some cocktails at the bar instead whilst we waited. We saw others eating at the bar area and were able to locate menus etc and ordered a sharing starter at the bar. Bar man was arrogant and apathetic and we were unsure if he'deven put our order through. Had to chase up our starter and when it eventually Arrived it was wrong. The waiter spoke poor English and just rushed away with the wrong starter without explanation...another 15 minute wait!We ordered 4 mains inbetween this and the rude barman did not write anything down leaving us feeling anxious.The mains Arrived after another long wait and they were ok. The ribs were tasty but the chips were floppy and under-seasoned. We complained to our waiter about our starter at the time, who appeared to just gurn at us and failed to understand what we were saying, We asked for our starter to be taken off our bill as a gesture of good will but still he did not understand, We then asked for the manager, and were told to speak to the barman. We said to send him over to us then, but instead we had the rude barman shout over to us saying ""what's the problem?"" from behind the bar. Eventually we had a polite and extremely professional manager come to our table. He explained that we should not have waited so long and that the waiters first language was not English. We did manage to get our starter taken off our bill. All in all we were left feeling like due to the location of this restaurant the staff felt they could take or leave our custom. No effort involved and no tip left. Would not return."
"Had some delicious dishes here, really tasty. The food is pan-Asian and I had Rendang for the first time here! Heavenly - a huge portion of succulent and tender beef, slow cooked to perfection. Their cocktails are also yum and the decor is fun, tastefully shabby chic! Family friendly and staff are helpful and welcoming. Good for lunches and dinners."
"Was the first time I have been, we had the tasting menu and I have to say the food was amazing, definately would go back again and try other things on the menu."
Booked last minute a party of 8 . They fit us in with great service and tasty Indian vegetarian curry!
".Stayed here before. Friendly and efficient staff.Good choice of menu, and excellent choice at breakfast.Shown to table asap, even at busiest times."
"I stayed at the Premier Inn at St Mary At Hill and didn't want cooked breakfast so went to this Pret to get something.I bought a Focaccia bacon roll, tomato ketchup sachet and a decaf Americano for the very reasonable price of £4 to take away.The staff were lovely, really bright and shiny friendly.My purchases were put into a paper carrier bag and I took it back to the hotel to enjoy."
There are not so many thai restaurants in the City so i was happy to bump into this one on London wall. The restaurant is on lower ground floor in a nice traditional thai setting.I found the food very authentic with a good variety of choice. My drunken noodles were prepared just perfectly and other dishes were also lovely.
Fabulous Italian
"Paolo's is classic Italian. We're local so it's a regular. We had a family birthday last night. Everything was as excellent as ever, but took son's vegetarian girlfriend who said her ravioli starter was ""the nicest thing I have ever had""Can't say farer that that can you?"
"Open-air indoor restaurant (with heated seats) complemented by the vibrant atmosphere at covent garden and the street singers and performers. Friendly staff, flavorful pizza with lincolnshire poacher, westcombe jacks and pulled pork. Perfect for solo dining."
The buzz in this open air restaurant is amazing. Lots going on and the food accompanies the place. I munched on my burger whilst people watching and listening to the performer nearby. Waitress was a bit dizzy but it ticked every other box.
"I stopped by the GBK with so e frie ds, it's decent service with good burgers. But nothing exceptional. I had better burgers at 5 guys."
"It's the Second time we've visited in the last few months; this place is excellent. Try and get a table upstairs on the balcony overlooking the bar and kitchen. This time we went early on Friday evening we had a cocktail at the upstairs bar first it felt like we were in a club playing live music. The food is excellent this time we had the Monico 3 course set menu which is great value at £19. We can thoroughly recommend tomato and mozzarella, cured salmon and cucumbers, bavette of beef and the star of the show for us the tarte au citron. Will definitely be back."
"It was on the pleasant rooftop gardens at John Lewis where I was unfortunate enough to find the pop-up Rossopommodorro bar & restaurant. As i approached the bar, before even picking up a menu, I was greeted and asked what I'd like; nice... but give me a minute. Not a terrible start. However, when I went on to order is where the trouble began. My simple two-drink order couldn't have been more disastrous. The first, a bellini was poured right away. I was a bit disappointed it was a sticky, sweet, peach syrup but oh well. Then I waited for my cocktail. And waited some more. I waited as I watched the barman disappear out back. Then return. Then out back, again. Then I watched as he refilled the syrup bottle. Then watched as he did nothing. The other staff had to prompt him into making my second drink. Firstly he poured the vodka. I stopped him there. This cocktail doesn't have vodka. He spoke Italian (... possibly) with his colleagues who confirmed it should have rum not vodka. There was a look, a pause, a shrug and he continued. I, naturally, refused the drink. The manager got involved and agreed it was incorrect, then drank the cocktail himself stating that they had changed the recipe recently (changed the rec of a classic cocktail?? What?! ). I was offered to keep the drink, but told the manager he could keep it- although I'm quite shocked he drank it there and then. The second cocktail was poured correctly. More italian was spoken as I then waited to pay. And waited. And watched. And waited and watched. Again I was ignored- standing right there with my money in hand. I walked off with the drinks and left soon after. Absolutely disgusting at staff, as with a lot of reviews. I don't know how John Lewis accepts this level of service from a concession."
"There are a few Breaksfast Clubs around London. Expect queueing at peak hours since its an extremely popular place for brunch on weekends. If you can pop in during a week day, you wont have to wait for so long and you can hang around as much as you please...Defo try pancakes or huevos rancheros... you will be back! <3"
This is always one of my first & last stops in London (yes there is one at Heathrow) and though they stopped making my favorite little croissant sandwich I always find yummy sandwiches every time. I am so excited they are making their way into the US though the closest I have found was the train station in DC and I have emailed the company I know they move slowly cause they are so committed to being able to provide great fresh food so someday they might make it out west and I will be ready!
We had lunch there recently. The restaurant appears to have expanded in size and it also looks like it is under new management. Service was efficient but the food was mediocre at best. We were there around 1 p.m. and the restaurant was virtually empty. Hmm.
Lovely find just by walking down the road. Great dim sum and noodle place and just nice not to have to go to the usual other chain stores of this type. Will be back.
Sorry Pret a Manager. I assume you are a great place to eat but unfortunately you were the first on the forced selection list.
"It was rainy, my phone was on on 11% and I'd walked all the way from Kings Cross, and I couldn't have ended up somewhere more perfect.I had a Leon Goni and it was truly delicious, warming and wondrously flavoursome! Fast and friendly service, filling and fulfilling food! Been before, will go again, no doubt!"
"It's dark, romantic, trendy, edgy and with all wine bottles at £20!A very good selection and good service. I will definitely go there more often!"
"Wandering through Borough Market, the guy on the door asked what sort of food I was looking for and gave me a fair account of several places nearby, while describing his own place - specialising in organic and seafood. Having looked at a few others I came back. Inside there is a bar and tables. The waiting staff were helpful and very knowledgeable without being false or overpowering. The food was really good - small plates of fish dishes, each a study in balance and detail - razor clams with black pudding; red snapper in a sweet Spanish pickle sauce, the pickled vegetables that accompanied this were a marvel; cod with samphire; mussels with sea lettuce. and an organic white wine 'on the lees' that was slightly sparkling. The large bearded chef was frequently in the front of house chatting animatedly with the lunchtime diners about the food. Overall, an afternoon well spent."
"The food made me want to give The Princess of Shoreditch just 1 star, but that wouldn't be fair to the service and ale. I ordered fish of the day, hake, that was served completely raw in the middle. So raw it was not even warm. At first I put this down to an excusable mistake since the fish was thick and clearly fresh. However when I asked for it to be taken away and replaced, the kitchen simply microwaved it. The fish pieces stayed in the exact same position and they did not cook a fresh piece. This is what I consider outrageous. The correct response is to cook a fresh piece (since this is fish, not steak, and certainly not sashimi grade fish), and offer a free drink. Instead they clearly microwaved the plate and offered to remove the service charge. I was not unhappy with the service, the service was great, I was unhappy with the food. The convention is to offer free drink(s), not remove service charge.In conclusion, the pub appears to be out of its depth. It does not know how to be a gastro pub. It's menu, price and claims should match its capabilities."
"Went here with some friends, liked the atmosphere in the bar which also had a really good range of drinks. The food is pretty good also."
"As a massive fan of well-cooked, great quality meat, I was so looking forward to eating at Temper. But I was massively disappointed and it's clear that the restaurant needs to improve massively if it wants to solicit repeat custom from Soho's discerning diners. The Neil Rankin name may very well reel in the foodies, but if this place wants these customers to come back again, things need to change.A colleague and I booked a very early reservation - 5.30pm on a Wednesday, right at the beginning of December, before we had to attend a work event. Things were disappointing the moment we got there.The place is obviously trying to be uber cool and current - reservations are all done via tablet computer. So, you walk in, and you're greeted by three people...except you're not really 'greeted'. They were just staring at their screens. God knows why 3 people were stationed there. It wasn't busy at all, they made no effort to welcome you warmly, they were just engrossed by the tech. It was really cold and inhospitable, totally unwelcoming! You had to cough to get their attention.Eventually, a lady clocked us and led us downstairs to the restaurant. Despite being pretty much empty, we were offered quite possibly the worst seats in the house...until we put our foot down and challenged this.So, eventually we were given a semi decent table. On to the food and drink...Well, I found it quite strange that (at the time, anyway) the prices on their website were NOT the same as the prices on the hard copy menu in the restaurant. Slightly false advertising...All would have been forgiven if the food was great, but it was mediocre at best. The waitress comes over and proudly declares that there is popcorn served with their sweetcorn, crushed up Monster Munch dust (yes, as in the crisps?!) on one of their starters and that their ketchup has MSG in! It's proudly called MSG Ketchup on the menu?! The 'brains' behind some of these suggestions seriously needs to be fired.The baby gem lettuce was nice, the cheesy potatoes so-so...but what should have been the crown jewel of the meal was absolutely rubbish. We were hungry and both ordered 400 grams of the lamb each. It looked like it had been thoughtlessly dumped on the plate on top of a couple of shawarma wraps. You couldn't differentiate between any of the cuts of lamb. I'm sure the restaurant manager will turn around and say, ""but this is the best lamb in the country that we source"", but I'm going by taste and what it looked like. Considering there's an open pit fire, the meat was completely devoid of flavour...no delicious, charred notes of smokiness whatsoever, it just tasted and looked like cheap kebab meat. It all tasted exactly the same, you couldn't discern one cut of the lamb from another. It was just...massively disappointing. And the bill came to £110 for 2 (including only 2 small glasses of red wine).If you want excellent meat in Soho, make sure that Blacklock is number 1 on your list. It's the best place ever! Temper doesn't even come close and wishes it could be that good. Or, go to Zelmans Meats, or MASH, for better meat. This place is all style over substance, don't bother wasting your money here."
"Away from the busy tourist areas of London, this branch of Polpo does not disappoint. Deliciously tempting small dishes are ideal for sharing which is a must if you want the full Polpo experience. Reasonably priced, Polpo is a great choice for friends who want to dine together but it's also popular for relaxed business lunches. In the evenings things get livelier; there's a sit-at bar for more casual dining and as the lights go down and the music goes up, there's more of a party feel. Always on my list of places to go."
"Having worked in this area most of my life, and now retired, did not know this pub existed. Met some family here last Sunday morning and pleasantly surprised. A beautiful building, well kept and respected and the staff were very helpful and friendly, especially when asked about the history of the building.We just had drinks but the food coming up around us looked very good. Will return."
Another delicious meal at this bistro!The staff know how we like our meal cooked and are so attentive to our needs we do visit a couple of times a month.
I will be going back. It is fun and will make you smile. This is not a place about the food but about the experience. We were transported into a small theatre for the night.Saw a string quartet and two opera singers.Fab. The staff were so friendly.
Visited with two friends and was treated to really good service and steak truly cooked blue - a rarity in the UK. Melt in the mouth deliciousness pairs beautifully with the house Malbec.The pudding - a crÌ¬me de leche cheesecake with marshmallow and salted caramel sauce was exquisite!A fabulous meal in a great and attentive environment.
"Everytime I go to London I have to visit Pret. It's convenient because it has locations everywhere, the food is fresh and the prices are not too bad. I love the sandwiches, toasts, wraps, porridge and yoghurt. The fruit, baked goods and soups look delicious too. I love the concept and how they position themselves in the market. Service is good and the staff are always helpful and smiling."
"We all went to this place in evening, Fried calamari, Prawns , Full grilled chicken, complemented by beer was a different experience. Enjoyed family dinner at this place."
"Incredible to see, get their early and join a tour. There is a lot to see inside and it takes a good half a day to go around everything. The crown jewels display is fab but queues can gather quickly so again get in their early and spend all the time you like wondering back and forth past those huge incredible stones!"
"Went on new years eve with family and had an excellent meal, very enjoyable, great atmosphere, wonderful food, wine, and service. We had a French waitress (sorry forgot her name) who was superb. The chicken doesn't sound exciting but was fantastic!Highly recommended and not silly prices either."
"Ate here with a group of colleagues from Germany and Scandinavia. Food was very, very good. Fresh tasting and nicely spicy.Quite small, so need to book.Sent Japanese and Swiss colleagues back here the following evening, who also commented how good it was!"
"We had a fairly limited window for dinner before going to a gig at the Palladium. We chose Bar Remo as it is an independent and just a little off the beaten track, compared to Oxford St, Aygyll St, etc. The restaurant was already busy at around 1900 but we were seated quickly and our order taken within five minutes of sitting down. It was a good menu-we both chose pizzas due to the time constraints and these were delicious- lovely thin, crispy base and good toppings. We shared a bowl of mixed Italian ice cream for dessert, again very good. The lady who served us was very warm, friendly and attentive. A carafe of tap water with mint was provided without us having to go through the whole 'still/sparkling' fiasco that a lot of restaurants persist in pushing. Wine prices were reasonable for central London and sparkly is available by the glass- always a plus for me! Finally, our bill was brought swiftly when we requested it and we were on our way to the gig in plenty of time. I recommend this restaurant highly."
"The Wasabi we went was located near Harrods, quite crowded at lunch but we didn't spend long on queuing. We had sushi and a bento rice, they are all taste good."
"After having visited here on our last trip to London we were determined to visit it again to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed. Excellent food and service as usual! We had the Jack Daniels Pork Belly, Hot Wings (although we asked for boneless) although this was not a problem as both were delicious! We followed with cajun spiced chicken stack which was tasty although the tostadas were slightly overdone. My husband struggled with the size of the jack daniels chilli dog as he is not used to such large sausages!"
"Pret a manger is very good restaurant chain, with good food and good coffee in each restaurant. I would choose this over Starbucks."
"Having looked forward to finally trying this 'must' go to restaurant in Clapham, the final result after 2 years of wait, was distinctly disappointing. Ambitious combinations in small plates, which sound fabulous on paper but are finally not at all exciting, or too salty or too smokey ( a lot of smoked items) or undercooked ( pork). A shame as the actual products are of quality ( monkfish, pollock etc) but it really lacks the 'wow' factor. Service is like the food, seems good at first impression, then disappears into non presence and the appears at end to make up ( too late!) for certain absence! Shame ...."
"Fortunately we discovered the Pret early on in a 3 week tour through the UK. All the food is excellent, especially the sandwiches. Prices are excellent and any of the locations are a great place to eat or get takeout if you don't want to get a heavy lunch."
"The food was pretty good for the price, we weren't exactly expecting 5* but in London a good bar should be able to produce respectable food. The food was just that, a respectable effort, even if it won't set your world alight. We went on an Amazon Local deal - burger, chips, coleslaw, onion rings and beers so it was a pretty good price (I think around £16) for the quantity and quality of food. It was a Monday night so we weren't expecting it to be too busy, but they were running a niche cinema upstairs which meant there were a few more people than we had expected which was nice. The wash facilities left a little to be desired though."
"I was introduced to Rules a number of years ago and it has become a firm London favourite. Elegant, 'old school', established and establishment would all be apt descriptions. One thing it is not, and makes no attempt to be, is progressive.The menu is traditionally English. There is more than a whiff of boarding school about it. Whilst the food has not moved with the times this is precisely what we, as traditionalists, would expect. The dining experience is not about celebrity chefs and contemporary presentation but rather timeless favourites, excellent ingredients and cooked using traditional recipes and techniques.With respect to the service, I have always considered it to be excellent. It is attentive whilst being unobtrusive. Whilst another contributor notes ""Though the staff wasn't rude, they were also not particularly welcoming."" this would actually be my preference. I suspect from the contributor's location (California) that their assessment is more to do with cultural differences and the accordant expectations. On this occasion I came to have dinner with my brother and an old friend, not the waiting staff so I for one am more than content when they manage to remain anonymous but are available when required.I will continue to dine at Rules and I hope that it continues to remain unchanged. I suspect that we will good companions for as long as they don't interfere with their time tested formula."
"The restaurant was really busy when me & my boyfriend got there, but service was good & food was quick and tasty!"
I called in for a classic cheese for lunch.A few tables that you can sit at after you have placed your order and waited for a pre made up sandwich to be put on the hot grill and heated through.Product was quite nice and at £4 good value.Enjoyable.
"Easily visible along the station parade of Chingford, you'll find this open plan compact eaterie, along with it's sibling Ninos bar adjacent (sharing the same kitchen)There nothing special about the decor, normal for a local, but the food has genuine flavour,..however..like the decor, it isn't 'ristorante perfetto'. Pizzas are cooked not quite the italian thin based way, but more the english-likes-it-this way method, and overwhelmed with thick cut portions of toppings..so most won't mind but needed more of a authentic feel with seasoningThe Marinara was much more fulfilling, a well made and well cooked fish dish..pity then a undercooked chicken accompanied another dish with well cook but bland vegetablesYou get a great feel here when you sit down, but the cost of the dishes,typically £12, £2-4 above average.. and the pollo taken out of the oven too early makes us think twice"
Enjoyed a nice bowl of pasta with very tasty meal balls accompanied by a glass of prosecco cocktail. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. They have a very varied menu with something for everybody. Great for a quick lunch or an evening meal likewise.
"Brand new restaurant in a cool part of King's Cross, nicely done out, staff are really friendly.There's basically no point reviewing the food because the prices are so ridiculous, and the meze portions are laughably tiny. In a group of friends we racked up £50 a head, having basically had a few morsels of humous and bread.ive attached a picture of the octopus. 1 tentacle (gone in 1 mouthful) - £13.I had to eat when I got home.There's just no excuse for leaving a restaurant starving and £50 lighter."
"To start with the staff were disorganized and incompetent. Each member of staff should have a set job and stick to it i.e. one at the till one sorting the orders. Walked in customers standing all over the place as no place to queue. People are served in a random order with no logic.When finally got served told it would be a 12-15 minute wait agreed to this. 20 minutes later went to inquire what was happening they had run out of chips. They put the fish in the box and waited an extra 10 minutes for the chips. Had to ask for fresh fish as by this point cold.Staff were flustered one girl standing literally doing nothing. Once got food it was luke warm, fish was soggy and falling apart the chips were under cooked even though we waited 25 minutes for them.On top this is not cheap it's extortionate for what you get."
"Centrally located in Commercial street on the corner of Wentworth road and its famous market.It is a very large restaurant with a bar downstairs. It also has a clean and an impressive open kitchen with an extensive menue to choose from.Everything we ordered were freshly cooked in the open kitchen, and to perfection.We liked the way the items of food were presented with a great attention to detail, and excellence.The prices are reasonable, but like many London restaurant they add 12% service charge to the bill which is not optional."
"Just left this restaurant after a dreadful meal. Starters took forever to come but once they did it was pretty good. The main courses however was a completely different story. Every one of us had a bad meal, my husband had nachos as a main the tortilla chips were stale, my son had a sirloin med / rare got a well done steak, my daughter had half a rack of ribs and chips and there was literally 4 single ribs in the half rack??? My son sent his steak back and they dealt with it pretty well and said he wouldn't be charged for his meal which is good customer service but as for the rest of the service it was hit and miss. We literally had to keep trying to get our waitress s attention. Overall it was the worst £25 each we spent in any restaurant and I have no idea how they get away with serving such bad food and still stay in business and constantly busy!! Stay away from this place, apart from the atmosphere there is nothing good about it."
This is a wonderful Japanese restaurant. The food and service are always excellent. Its very down to earth but delicious and good value. We are lucky to have a number of Japanese restaurants in the area but this is the best
I crossed this pub a lot of time since I was staying right across. I landed up their on a friday night and to my surprise i saw a nice crowd with some good music playing. there is a small dance floor.A huge variety of beers are on offer.
"I had the best Thai food in London and very authentic to the one in Thailand.The service was fantastic .I had calamary,Jungle chicken curry and coconut rice-best choise ever,recomended from my waiter Paulina"
"Stopped in on a whim on New Year's Eve en route to watch the NYE fireworks. OK, that's not true, stopped in because I desperately needed a place to pee, but also stopped for a quick refreshment! Anyway, found this place to be a very warm, friendly place. The bar staff were incredibly helpful and really worked to make you feel welcome. Since I don't drink alcohol the only thing I can personally recommend is the ginger beer. Good stuff, a great atmosphere, and I'd definitely return whenever I'm in London :)"
Busy lunchtime on Friday. No reservation so left name for 230pm (one hour wait). Returned 220pm and were promptly seated. Everything perfect! Kedgeree starters excellent. Mayfair classic fish and chips (cod) superb! Best mushy peas in my life! A must do in London if you are a fish and chip afficianado!Total to be determined but entree about 14 gbp . Pint of draught about 7 gbp. Do it!
"We happened to walk in for a late Sunday lunch while the ""hurling"" championships were being televised. The pub was packed with loyal fans and customers...we happened to sit next to the owner and his family who proceeded to explain the rules of the game and made us feel quite at home. Homemade food, delicious beer and a great crowd!"
I Go to ibleos regular but last week our boss took 14 of us out couldn't fault the service or the food out of all the people that I have been to ibleos with we have never had a bad meal I had the fillet steak and what a steak it was I had to bring a piece home for the Dog
On our rare visits to London we would so much rather be wined and dined by Patrick in his lovely restaurant than to feel ill at ease elsewhere. Patrick is a charming host who delights in the special quality of all that he and his team serve to their appreciative clientele who return regularly in the knowledge that they will leave satisfied at having been in one of London's genuine French restaurants.
"Loulou is part of a great social club, with separate bar areas, sushi bars, library, and priveate dining rooms - it's perfect for any social gather. The atmosphere is so relaxed yet fun. Staff and services are among top quality in the world. Totally worth a visit"
"It's in currently a dead end road with new flats being built .There is a small sign saying Parlour by an old pub , flashy it ain't .However inside a good welcome , cavernous old pub with restaurant off ,and note for the summer a pretty decent outside area .This is of the bull and last school , straightforward food and friendly service, chicken Kiev a meal on its own ,you don't need a starter, excellent , then pouter fish pie ,equally excellent tasty ,light ,Actually don't tell anyone but better than the one at sheekey ..Liked this place , the style of the moment is simplicity , posh restaurants are going down this route But this place is there to start with,There is room for white tablecloths , don't worry , they will return , but good food at reasonable prices plus personal service is in the ascendant -good."
Came here with the wife for lunch. I had an advocating and black bean wrap which was great and very filling. Wife had a banana and we both had a cappachino. All in excellent surroundings with very clean facilities .
"We came here before and loved it, do went back again and had a 2nd positive experience. Both times the waitress's made the difference. I asked for fresh mint in hot water TEa and she made it for me. I then wanted honey which they did not have and she found that a well. Food was tasty, good and do t feel stuffed at the end of it! Would recommend if in the area"
1. Fantastic food. 2. Good quality ingredients 3. Great portions 4. Wonderful service 5. Moderately priced ...what else could you want from an Italian. If you are in the neighbourhood definitely try it out!
"We dined here last week and found the staff extremely unfriendly. We had one child and absolutely no effort was made to cater for her at all. The staff did not even show us the table d'hote menu which was displayed at the front door and actually served as the wrong (more expensive) wine as opposed to the one we ordered. Plates were cleared from the table whilst other diners were still eating - not expected from this alleged up market eatery.The food was unexciting and although it was reasonably well cooked, the surly attitude of the staff made our decision easy - we will not be back. Pity as the name should mean that you can count on the venue for quality."
We enjoy the food and the atmosphere. Our octopus was a bit stiff but all the rest plates was amazing
"Good value, tasty food just on the broadway. Would recommend for small groups decent sized menu and service was good. Will absolutely go back."
Food served very hot and large portions. Do not need a starter as mains are massive.Service is excellent. Very friendly and pleasant staff. Great dessert menu.
"Gotta go to Bone Daddies - great staff, great ambience, HAVE to have the moshi ice cream! Loved the bibs and the hair ties!"
"Eat out a lot, expensively and cheaply, and this is the place I look forward to going to most. Never had a bad or indifferent meal here. The food is imaginative, the room is simple and stylish, and the staff welcoming and friendly. There's an outside space, too, which is perfect for warm days. Just wish they'd open in the evenings."
"All kind of great sandwiches, salads...Love the peking duck wrap! Perfect for quick lunch and come back to work"
"Glad I read the reviews so I knew what to expect. I chose the Gentleman's afternoon tea menu with Champaign and free strawberry Bellini (£32) as I was intrigued by the steak and snail sandwich. The food, as others have said was OK. Small portions but this is afternoon tea and not a meal replacement so not expecting to be stuffed.The warm savouries come on a warming platter, The beef and snail sandwich is just a 6x3 cm piece of bread with a couple of slices of warm pink beef with a dollop of something which could have been minced snails but as expected tasted of garlic and parsley. The fishfinger is a similar size and rests on a couple of dollops of roughly pureed peas (No serving utensils provided although it's hardly finger food). Finally a sausage roll which was OK but nothing special. Sandwiches on the vintage afternoon tea looked betterWhere it was different was the range of miniature tarts and cakes (& I mean miniature- treacle tart was just 2 cm in diameter). All had excellent taste. There is also a banana & custard which comes in a shot glass but nothing to eat it with. As others have said, the redeeming feature of it all is the free flow of Champaign that comes your way for the 2 hour slot you have and there was no stinting. VFM on that score alone.We retired to the bar which is more gentleman club that the restaurant area and had a couple of cocktails. One of which we had to send back as the barman seemed to be using a different recipe to the advertised. That was only instance of poor service, rest was excellent."
"We went here six of us for a pre matinee lunch. Hangmen was actually a bit disappointing but the theatre deal included a complientary glass of Kir Royale at the restaurant which we gratefully accepted. Good start. We ate from the set lunch menu. We had two courses and shared three puddings. The food was excellent. Starters were beetroot salad with goats cheese, Pork rillette and soup and all were good. The main courses were outstanding. Sea bass Chicken and Roquefort salad and chicken were brilliant and certainly large enough portions. Fries were good too. Creme Caramels are the best about. So it is a large restaurant but you still need to book to be sure. I dont believe there is better value in London or any large European city. Outstanding. The service was good but like all Theatre restaurants everyone wants their bill at the same time so you need to beat the rush."
"A family booking of ten,four with dietary needs and we were very well looked after.Every course served fresh and hot.Great authentic restaurant with brilliant food."
"In a recent business trip to London we decided to go to union jacks for dinner. We decided to go as we had heard good things about it. However the food and drink was a little disappointing, I had the fish and chips which wasn't great! And one of my colleagues had the burger and he wasn't really impressed. However the location and atmosphere was great and I'm glad we paid the restaurant a visit as its been on my things to do list for a while. I wouldn't go back mind."
"Some great places have been popping up in Hackney for a while now and Hash E8 is up there with the best. They serve what I would describe as world-class breakfasts in this little cafe. It's a humble, friendly environment and the staff are very cool. I highly recommend the ""belly Benedict"" (eggs Benedict with a slice of pork belly on top). My favourite breakfast/brunch spot in Hackney by a long shot. It's also dog-friendly."
"It's an ok place I suppose, the coffee is reasonable, but sandwiches and things are pricey for what they are. It doesn't have the same comfortable atmosphere as a starbucks or costa."
I cannot judge the food as I didn't have it however every dish that passed in front of you looked amazing. We went there for drinks on a Saturday around 6pm and the bar was already busy but not crowded. The professional bartenders will make you feel like we were in the 50's. The list of cocktails is endless and I fell in love with the Mayfair Ladies cocktail and yes they are pricey but it is quite worth it.
"Lunch on a voucher deal of steak or lobster burger with fries and half a bottle of wine per person. Opted for the steak meal which was tasty, cut up into slices with a field mushroom and a generous helping of fries on the side. White wine was drinkable, and nicely chilled. Service was friendly and attentive."
"We went on daughters 21st birthday which was her choice we Arrived and taken to the gallery but first we left our coats and shopping bags at the cloak room.. the gallery is exactly like all the pics we were seated and asked which afternoon tea we wanted .. the food came which wasn't the greatest it didn't blow my mind the waitress explained what was on the plate and what to eat first the taste to me wasnt the best .. we were told we can ask for more but we didnt the tea, there was a good choice but without asking they kept topping up my cup which I didn't like i could have done it myself .. we were offered a cake from the trolley which were horrible but that's just my choice .. the table was ours for 2 hours but just after and hour they were clearing our table they even moved our food which I hadn't finished I couldn't be bothered to make a fuss I think the table shouldn't be cleared until 2 hours .. they then after hour half gave me the bill out bill was £157 I gave £160 buy got no change I wasn't even asked of I wanted change (I didn't want it) but if let's say your bill was £141 and you only had £20 notes or £50 notes i don't think you'd get change so beware !!! I wouldn't go again the loos are intresting but if your disabled there's no way getting up the stairs to the loos you best calling and asking about the loos... I probably won't go again"
Went for lunch here and have also been for drinks. It is fun for drinks but the food is ordinary at best. I had a burger which was tough and flavourless. Service and atmosphere were good. Not going back in a hurry
"This is my Thai of choice in Wimbledon. I think the Suk Saran has even better food, but it's a lot more expensive (£23 vs £15 for curry rice and coke) and anyway I prefer the feel of the MaiThai - it's cozy, great service, and good food. Recommended."
"Yes, you have to wait a while to get in, yes the service isn't that wonderful and yes you will in all likely hood have to sit next to some stranger but the ramen is pretty top drawer in my opinion and as a result I will continue to return as long as that continues."
Went with my sister. Great location. Katsu curry which ive never had before was really tasty. Very busy due to its location. Would definitely recommend and go again.
"an extraordinary experience in this restaurant!Really great beef perfectly cocked, super tasty risotto.The ambient is familiar, warm. The waiters are super nice and with a lot of disposability. The sommelier is really prepared with a great wine list.in a couple it's a restaurant of around 120-150 pound if you eat well and you drink moderately good more than 2 glass of wine.Really a great restaurant to try"
"Absolutely the best fish and chips I ever had. Came with couple of friends from North London after hearing positive feedback from my neighbour about their food. We all had what they call ""lunch time especial"" it was amazing very tasting and we'll presented. Plates, forks, knifes, cups and the tables were really clean. Perfect atmosphere! The young lady that assisted us called ""Nez"" she provided us excellent customer service so friendly and helpful. Can't wait to arrange another time to visit them and eat their delicious fish and chips. Keep it up guys you lot know the drill."
"We ventured in here for a meal after the theatre. We had our 5yr old Grandson with us & he had requested pizza. We have eaten in several different Jamie's, so hoped the quality was the same. We were not disappointed. We were eating early, so got seated straight away. The staff were helpful & polite. The children's menu at £7 was good value choice of drink, choice main meal & icecream. My husband had pizza & I had Lamb shank, food was good. Total bill including wine & a gin £59, not bad by London prices."
"I was taken here by some friends whilst visiting Greenwich, they promised fantastic food and good banter, and the green pea delivered! It's a little unconventional, there are no menus, instead upon arriveal you are greeted personally by owner and chef Tom, who will talk you through what he has available (and what you're allowed!). He's quite a character, with a great wit; make sure you bring your sense of humour to dinner!After placing our orders (pies all round, we were told for our first visit we had to have a pie!) we were able to relax with a drink while our food was prepared. The serving staff are very friendly, they brought our food out quickly and we were seated and tucking in without any fuss. The portion size is huge! With no starters, none of our party had room left for a dessert, so make sure you have an appetite! Over the course of the evening Tom was extremely busy, greeting everyone in the same fashion, the service is second to none.I don't have a single bad word to say about this meal, next time I'm in Greenwich I will definitely be back (assuming Tom lets me in!)."
I attended this restaurant with an old friend the food was great tasting. The staff were very attentive and explained all the meals on the menu accurately. I went with a deal for a three course and a cocktail. I was not disappointed and will definitely go again.
"Called in on a Saturday evening with friends for supper. One of the party was gluten free, however there was no allergy menu available, the waiter blaming 'the company' for this. We were offered paper document detailing all the menu and indicating the allergens in each item - which was a bit 'scruffy' but helpful, although we weren't overly convinced about the accuracy of some items - particularly the risotto which was marked as containing gluten, which is usually the safest bet for a Coeliac. So ultimately there was very little choice.The salad starters were average, but the mains were boring and cold. I left most of my meal. We had 4 waiters, one took the order, another delivered the food a third cleared the plates and a fourth brought the bill - so no continuity. No-one asked if we had enjoyed our meal.So whilst in a prime location, we will not be eating there again. There is plenty of choice in St. Katherine's Dock so choose somewhere else would be my advice."
My family had a great meal here at a Saturday lunchtime. It's right next to the world famous Borough Market and booking in advance is essential. The staff were all helpful and friendly and the menu was full of interesting ingredients (and quite short; often a good sign). We all enjoyed our meal and would go again.
"I have had a number of good meals at Prezzo in Mill Hill but this, sadly, was not one of them.  Three of our party of four ordered a starter of bruschetta, which, according to the menu, consists of Ïsliced cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, red onion, basil pesto and garlic on a baked flatbread. One of my companions asked the server to ensure that the dish included a reasonable amount of red onion, since on a previous occasion this ingredient had been conspicuous by its absence. But this request was ignored: we found that between the three of us we had no more than a teaspoonful of onion. On the plus side, there were plenty of cherry tomatoes, but the dish was swamped in far too much mediocre pesto. When it came to the main course, two of my companions had to complain about their pasta dishes, both of which showed little evidence of some of the advertised ingredients. For my own main course, I ordered spaghetti with lobster, Ïwith red onion, chilli, grilled courgettes, cherry tomatoes and parsley in a creamy pesto sauce with fresh rocket. The dish was served with a handful of rocket leaves dumped on top of it Ó which was fine. From within the pesto sauce I excavated several thin slices of grilled courgette, which tasted good, but (as with the bruschetta) there was very little red onion and (unlike the bruschetta) there were just two tiny cherry tomatoes. The main annoyance was that the only lobster I could detect consisted of four small cubes of lobster meat no larger than dice. When I expressed my disappointment to a senior member of staff, he said that lobster was diffused throughout the sauce. He may have been right, but the taste of the chilli-infused pesto was so overwhelming that it would clearly swamp the delicate flavour of any lobster content.  As usual, the service was good, and it did include an offer of free desserts and coffee because of our disappointment with our savoury dishes. One small niggle is that in an allegedly Italian restaurant it is annoying to be Ïcorrected for pronouncing the Italian word bruschetta the way Italians pronounce it."
"Luton Airport - Purchased 2 small boxed pasta dishes, 2 cakes and 1 coffee for over £14. The pasta tasted of nothing but pepper it was actually inedible it was so strong and so was left. With a queue building and call for our flight we had to leave. In effective we had 2 cakes and a coffee for £14. Won't use again anywhere."
"Delicious Italian cooking in a quiet street in central London. This is a lunchtime favourite during the workweek because you can always get a table, the meals are made fresh to order and the staff are so friendly. They will make you feel welcomed each time and will even know your favourite dish. Definitely worth a visit if you're near Marble Arch or in the area."
"Food was very standard to sub standard, our server scowled at us constantly and the whole experience was not that pleasant. Service was quick and the place was half empty.. Honestly maybe she was a having a bad day, she said all the right words bit the body language and tone were horrible."
We were at this pub for a family lunch. One of my nephews was visiting from the U.S. Our party ranged in ages 74-15 and as the menu was varied everyone had a good range of choices. Impressive range of craft beers too. I have to say the staff were excellent and nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely be returning
"Pret a Manger is a chain of sandwich (and other things) restaurants located in many London neighbourhoods and in major and minor cities throughout the United Kingdom. Their menu is common to all outlets and includes breakfast items as welll as a range of sandwiches, wraps, soups, salads and pastries at different price levels depending upon the cost of the ingredients.There are 2 soups available each day and these are excellent value as they are served with a crusty bread roll and butter.Each Pret a Manger is as consistently good as any other. Tou cannot go wrong with chain."
"Good wholesome home cooked Italian favourites. Very small. It's essentially a cafe, with a few tables squeezed in to eat at. I wouldn't call it a restaurant. Nice atmosphere."
"Wonderful food, fresh and not bathed in butter. This has been a problem for us at many restaurants in London, so this was a real find for us. The service was excellent. We let them know of an olive allergy in the party, and when one dish came out with olives (that does not usually have them as a garnish) the waiter caught it and sent it back, returning soon with another. It is not quiet, as it is on a mezzanine floor overlooking the bar below, but the setting is gorgeous."
"Party booking with 17 eating on the night. Waitress was fantastic even if the food wasn't.Nothing to write home about the food, mediocre and bland. Didn't help that 3 mains came out wrong. Gluten free option was stodgy and dissapointing. Waitress on the otherhand was great and made our evening where the kitchen failed."
"If you want quick tasty imaginative vegetarian food with no fuss, then mildreds is the place to go the food is filling and tasty. And the layout is cute a bit tight. The juices are small for the price.The staff are friendly.0"
"This chain puts McDonalds to shame! All in-shop-made sandwiches, cookies, snacks . . . easy to select, easy to pay . . . good coffees too! Simple, fast, tasty, healthful! What's not to like? Grabbed a snack in several locations and loved it."
"Spent an evening here in November as it was right opposite our air b&b. Great atmosphere, superb service and fabulous food. Cocktails to start with were delicious, we then had a couple of the banquets between us and have nothing negative to say on any of it. The lobster was amazing! Would go again for a treat"
"A pleasant bar in Mayfair central London. Although attractive as a bar, I had to wait for service despite being asked to sit down and await service. I was forced to get up and ask to be served. That had an immediate effect and the service and drinks offered were good. Probably that particular evening, but it was low on atmosphere when I was there."
"This chain is everywhere in London. Train stations, Heathrow, around the city, etc. kind of a grab and go place. Coffees, pastry, yogurt, sandwiches, etc . Good selection to choose from. We hung out there for a couple of hours at Heathrow prior to our flight home. Multiple times I have wished there was a location here in Texas."
"I had a meal deal, burger, small fries and a fizzy water for 9.95. A great deal. The burger was cooked well, medium rare as I like it. Some chains refuse to do that. The sauce was just right and the bun was also grilled so it did not become soggy. All in all well worth it. I would say much better than the Five Guys down the street."
"We booked The Tavern for a cricket club annual dinner in November.Finding a quality venue at the right price in London was a real challenge with most places requiring large up-front payments or minimum spends on the night.From the beginning Alex and her team were outstanding, advising on menu and drinks options for 50 people as well as sorting out the logistics and seating arrangements on the night. They couldn't have been more helpful and were always available in the preceding weeks to deal with changes and questions.The evening itself went without a hitch. The food was outstanding (not something that we were expecting from mass catering) with many people commenting that it was of the same quality that you'd expect of a meal for two. Superb value for a world famous boozer. We've decided to make this an annual fixture!If you're looking for an outstanding quality event space for a large group, at a historic venue, you can't go far wrong here.Call Alex. She's a good laugh too!Ploughmans Cricket Club."
Lovely food and drinks. A little noises due to the casinos players below but that became entertainment for us both. The restaurant has a really good atmosphere. The other resturant goers were also really nice and friendly. I guess we were lucky. The staff were really professional and were able to recommend when we were in doubt. The only downside was that I wasn't able to take a doggy bag home (I was not able to eat all my food).We were able to get discounted parking from the casino as we parked in the NCP car park around the corner. I don't know if they still have that offer anymore.
"I booked the three course and a glass of prosecco for £25ph. The resteraunt is very stylish, great welcome and service. My companion had the Prosecco and I had some great red wine. The service was attentive, the tables were spread so easy access available. The food was tasty and fresh, a great place to eat!"
"Sri Thai City was recommended buy a Thai friend as I was looking for a Thai restaurant in the city. The interior was nice and relaxed and even for a late Tuesday evening in the city there was a few people eating.For started we had a variety of starters which was very good, don't remember the name but was the last opinion in the starters menu . For main we had monk fish and king prawns with chilli paste & green been, with spiced aubergine and mixed vegetables, I would definitely recommend the monk fish for the fish lovers, and the spiced aubergine give a good touch if you not feeling like rice. Good detail is that as we were talking we spend almost an hour in the starters, but when finished the mains came shortly afterwards and still hot, as the starters took so long to finish (due to the chat to be clear) could be that they were a bit cold but no. The food was very tasty and you could feel the different ingredients and spices. I would be returning to try the sea bass as I heard is one of the specialities. If you are around the city, this is a very good option if you like Thai food, and if you don't, try you may change your mind:)Thanks again"
As part of a football hospitality package we had 3 course meal.Food was very good and tasty.The service was very friendly but very hap hazard. Bit of training needed in setting the table and my pet hate continues - take the orders then arrive at the table and as who's having what - just a simple table setting would cure this. Enjoyed the Champagne!
Tucked away at one end of Drury Lane this place is easy to miss - make a point of looking for it. On a Saturday lunchtime it was surprisingly busy but service was quick and friendly with a good choice on the menu and several specials. Food was excellent - generous portions and nicely presented. I had the bacon and brie salad with walnuts which was delicious. Very handy for Covent Garden and theatres.
"P-a-M bailed us out of several jams when timing, travel, distance, etc. put us hard up for time to have dinner of lunch. It's never more than a block or two away--or it seems do in London---and the food is consistent, fresh and well-prepared. This became our ""Starbucks"" while in the UK."
"By chance went to this lovely restaurant pub, and had great food and super service from staff. A guy called Sandri looked after us and spoke excellent English and knew what drinks went well with our food. Service was seconded to none thank you all, and special thanks to our waiter."
"We held a business meeting at the Trafalgar Hotel, London and decided to get lunch outside the hotel.I visited Pret A Manager and they had a selection of food to suit our guests from overseas.The food was very fresh and the staff was very helpful.We will continue to use Pret A Manager for our informal business lunches."
"The food here is great! However, everything else about our visit was pretty poor. Don't know if it was because we had the 'cheap seats' by booking the star deal (9 courses and a cocktail -29), but the service was shocking! Had to ask three times for each drink, the menu and our bill. Despite an awful lot of staff being present.If it wasn't for the dreadful service I think we would have been in and out in 40 mins. We were positively rushed through our courses. Fine at lunch.....felt like they wanted rid of us for dinner.Really begrudge a 13% service charge when the service is poor."
"An artistic front and elegant ambiance inside. The cafe is airy and filled with sophistication. Their desserts range from scones, to specialty cakes. A must-try is their Cafe Royal strawberry cheesecake to go with either coffee or tea. I did not find their hot chocolate as special. They offer 3 for £5 for when you get either French macaroons or scones. I would say it is a tough competition between Caffe Concierto which is just across Regent street but the latter is kinder on the purse. Nonetheless, Cafe Royal is a brilliant place for respite from all the shopping buzz and rush hour. (If you need to use their uber posh restrooms, you'll have the pleasure of seeing the hotel's main restaurant, The Grill which is adjacent to the cafe and the bar as you need to walk along the side of their magnificent dining hall.)"
"what a warm welcome we received! Wonderful place to eat and drink, inside or outside you have great views of the river and the Houses of Parliament, the London Eye and the Waterloo Bridge. Lovely food and excellent service. Just give it a try you won't regret it!"
"I stood a better chance of getting a priveate audience with the Pope than I did dinner. If you're dining alone, as a lot of people travelling for business will, forget it. If you manage to get seated without a snidey comment, you're unlikely to be served within the hour. Don't bother."
"An unplanned visit on new years eve, left us wanting to return here when visiting London the next time, we were looking for a drink and snack before descending to watch the fireworks and this place hit the spot. We sampled the home made Sausage rolls & Scotch eggs which were probably the best I have ever had. A great selection of beers and wines left us wanting to stay longer but midnight was soon approaching. The staff were great, had good humour and left us wanting to return. Thanks for making our visit rememberable."
"9 pounds for a very short list of cocktails, in a basement where you can barely hear what your friend is telling you due to the loud music and ambience. I guess all this has to do with being part of Shoreditch. No thanks, speakeasies are something different."
"Defying the rule good, fast, cheap, Pret a Manger delivers on all 3 fronts! When we were in London, we searched no further for Prets freshly squeezed juices, crisp salad rolls and delicous chocolate brownies. Better still, these guys seamed to have as many stores as MacDonalds so it is rediculously easy and convenient to eat fresh, fast and cheap meals while you are in London Town. Hoping these guys come down under soon!"
"I love Strada.....I do use them when I can. This one is a bit different for two reasons, one good, one bad. First the good. The food is up to the usual quality but with the added bonus of being in St Katherines. You are eating by the marina (if you sit outside) and have views of the Tower of London. This whole area is a great place to eat and drink. The downside, despite Strada as a barnd being on Tastecard, this location isn't, so the meal is a little more price than the same meal would cost you elsewhere, despite the food being exactly the same. I ate here on a glorious summers evening and it was busy. There are a lot of outside seats, so I would imagine that in the winter the inside is very packed. The service was great too, quick and with a smile !"
"Had an impromptu early dinner with my (adult) daughter. The serve was very good - attentive, friendly and helpful. The wine list wasn't as expensive as one person comments (a good selection of wines by the glass) and they also have a good selection of local artesian beers. the starters were very good and the mains good. I only have two comments regarding the menu which are the only things preventing the full 5 stars. The first is that the veggie options on the mains are limited (well - none). However they did do an excellent starter as a main for my daughter. The second is that there are some lovely looking things on the mains menu - which are only for 2 or 3 people to share! These were some of the more exciting things on the menu, but tricky if your dinner partner is vegetarian. I ended up with some very good lamb, which was cooked over wood and tasted fantastic.Coffee excellent, puddings looked good but we were full. Good value given quality of food and location. Very nice atmosphere - will return! 10/10 if you are looking for a meal as a group or a couple who fancy sharing some courses. Do book - we were first in (at 1800) but by 1730 the place was full with people queuing, and this was a Tuesday!"
"Some friends and I stopped off here on the way to Tayyabs. They brew a selection of varied beers: porter, stout etc..I had the bitter, which was excellent and reasonably prices (for London) at £3.60. They also serve a wide range of other beers. The service was pleasant and they let you sample before you buy. I liked the traditional decor as well. Wouldn't know about the food."
"Saw a few Pret a Manger stores while we were in London for 3 days. We finally tried one while we were at London St Pancras, on our way to Amsterdam. Omg. The food is delicious! Lots of choices and everything looked so organic and healthy! We were so bummed that we only found out about this on our last few minutes in London. No wonder Pret a Manger is everywhere in London! I wish we have something like this in New Zealand! When we got back to London, after touring around Europe, we were on a quest for Pret a Manger. And we enjoyed it :)"
"We had looked forward to going to this member of the Polpo restaurants producing italian ciccetti, but were rather disappointed. The whole experience was one of being processed. The tables were way too close, just 6 inches apart, and it was difficult to hear with noisy neighbours and loud music. The food started okay with nice arancini and followed by a pizzette of curly kale (good), but no sign of our other pizzette. We then tried two different types of meatballs - they were completely indistinguishable smothered in a bland tomato sauce together with a very soggy salad. Very disappointing. Then we were about to wind up when they suddenly produced the second pizzette. All a bit disinterested - staff going through the motions (and none of them italian regrettably). Wine young and expensive for what it was. We wont be back, there's too many good places nearby for that."
"Decided to try this restaurant as local to us. Whilst the restaurant is nice enough, the food wasn't. It wasn't seasoned, and had no taste. We had some mezze to start, but decided not to bother with a main. From the previous reviews, I'm guessing we either just ordered the wrong thing, or they had a different chef that night, or the reviewers are friends of the owners! On the upside the Lebanese wine was lovely! And so was the Baklava."
Been here a few times but not recently. Loved the food. Really strong flavours and spice. Good service. Would definitely go again.
"Mix feeling regarding this very hip place for dim sum in Soho . Always super busy u need to book in advance and only on line ( quite annoying considering I was there in person to make a booking for the night after and the extremely young girl at the front desk told I need to call the day after or go on line ...) Great atmosphere, very noisy and all table super packed close to each other, so definitely not ok for a romantic dinner. Food was ok but it took ages to materialise, even the drinks . If you have wine your bill will be even more expensive than you think , we paid around £ 55 each ...for dim sum ! I suppose we will go again with friends but not in a hurry"
"Maybe we were lucky, but we waked in at lunchtime on a Monday asked for a table and...ten seconds later we're seated. And it just got better from there. We started out with fried cashew, lotus root an plantain-a salty, spicy, crunchy snack perfect with a cold beer. Then on to deep, booming mutton rolls. Like the dirtiest ( in a good way) spring roll you've ever come across ( which I very nearly did.) Then came two fantastic karis, or curries to the rest of us, flecked with spices and curry leaves and perfect;y portioned. The best way to east them was to greedily scoop them up with the buttery, flaky rotis. I finished up with sweet chai which just seemed to reawaken the flavours we'd just experienced. Just a great wee restaurant. I'd say it's even worth a long wait."
"Very cosy place with very tasty pizzas. Owner is very nice, he seems to enjoy his job a lot and genuinely tries to give you the best service possible. Portion sizes are massive - I have never been served such a large bowl of soup before while the 18"" pizza can easily be shared between 3 people."
"We visited this pub on two occasions just for a drink. The first was in the day when we found it to be comfortable and the staff very friendly. When we returned later at night it started out similar but soon turned into one of the noisiest places ive ever been into - it was horrendous and impossible to hold a conversation. A request to turn the music down slightly fell on deaf ears (hardly surprising), so we voted with our feet!"
"Nice decor and easily seated although this was 4pm on a Friday afternoon.The Calamari didn't taste of anything. I couldn't decide on the pasta so I had a half and half dish which is a good idea. The spaghetti with king prawns which I asked for spicy which was ok but I felt was lacking flavour, garlic, basil, and the spaghetti with lobster, which also lacked flavour and the lobster wasn't great. My husband had the penne arribiatta which he has at every italian restaurant, which he said 'filled the gap'.The server didn't really seem bothered, just said she would pass my comments on to the kitchen. Disappointing."
"Popped in for glass of wine and some food after a long day of sightseeing after passing a few times on our way back to the nearby premier inn.Pubs like this are little gems, and although in London there are probably still a few left they are getting rarer in the rest of the country. Sign of the times I suppose.The staff were friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere and ambiance was perfect.The food was very tasty (we chose from the Thai menu) and plenty of it for our liking. There was a good selection of drinks and a decent food menu.I would recommend a visit even if only for a drink after or during your exploration of London.Great place"
"The food was delicious and very filling. BUT the service was terribly slow. We Arrived and ordered at 6pm, as we were going to the theatre just down the road for 7.30, should have been plenty of time. The starters came nice and quickly, however the main courses didn't come for over 45 minutes after we ordered. Several tables of people came, ordered and received their food while we were waiting. We asked a couple of times and never received a decent answer, both scurried off to find out where our food was, but did not return with an ETA, poor customer service. Once we finally received our meals, we felt the need to rush the meal to be in our seats for the show. The restaurant is small and there are lots of waiting staff, making the situation even more frustrating. Once we'd paid we realised the service charge had been automatically added on. We would not have left 10% had we realised, as the service was poor."
"Had set meal B, beautifully cooked and tasty, generous portions. Service was good. Would recommend. Good value."
"Being a fan of Jamie Oliver's Italian restaurants a visit to Union Jacks in Covent Garden was an appealing option for lunch. Being a bitterly cold day we elected to eat downstairs which was warm and welcoming with a good atmosphere and interesting decor. The staff were young, casually dressed, friendly and professional but with a modern, humourous approach which enhanced the experience. The food was to the usual high standard. The mussels were excellent and Sole for the main course was something special. My partner had a special steak burger which impressed her greatly. Being lunch time we decided to accompany the meal with pints of lager, perhaps not the professional diner's choice but definitely the right decision. This lager was different and I intend returning to find out what it was!"
"First the positives:- front of house staff very friendly and good service. Service was a touch slow at times but not sure if that was due to kitchen and wasn't slow enough for us to complain..- nice set-up and ambience- Food presentation very good.Negatives:- I didn't mind the menu where you select balls to tell them what you want. Having said that I was having a casual dinner with a friend - if it was more formal, it could be pretty distracting.- the supplements - agree with others - they are frankly ridiculous. Chicken with a supplement is a first for me (albeit I think it was because of the truffle)- the food - all things considered, it just wasn't that good. Of all the courses, not a single one stood out. Some dishes seemed to have too much going on - with the main piece of meat/fish surrounded by 5-6 things which didn't really work as a dish. Others just weren't cooked very well such as the lamb which was very tough and chewy.2 Michelin stars - not based on the quality of the food. But everything else was spot on (service, presentation)"
"This modern looking neighborhood pub on a quiet street belies what lies behind the bar whne you walk in. I solid three star to four star restaurant with very fresh ingredients and great service. The kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant and the scents, and odors coming from the kitchen makes you want to have dinner quickly instead of a drink. The food and wine prices are fair and the service attentive but not overpowering. What a great find given to me by some London friends and I will return."
"This is a local for me, and I love it. The food it always perfect, the wine list is exceptional as is the cocktails. I go again and again, and never disappointed. It's a little on the pricey side, but well worth the treat. Highly recommended."
"I always pop in for a glass or two of champagne and have been coming for around four years but unfortunately the place needs a tidy and attention!The ladies toilets definitely need attention, they aren't clean and are tatty.The first booth I sat in I was informed the heating wasn't working so moved but only the blowers worked and not the seat heating. Also the ""press for champagne""button didn't work and this is one of the attractions of the place. I had to wait ten minutes until I got someone's attention (despite standing up!)I also called in for breakfast. The waiter wasn't friendly and when I ordered pancakes was told they had run out (it was 10am, there were four other people in there and the pancakes are apparently ""freshly made"") so I went elsewhere.I love the Searcys champagne though.Please give this place attention as it is loosing its charm!"
Great foodGreat service - very friendly Extensive food choiceNice environment Reasonably pricedWalking distance from Dorsett hotel
"the food was good, wine was good and the service was good. all-in-all a very pleasurable experience."
"Went with a friend and ordered the 7 courses option.Sashimi was less than impressive. Sushi had some novel touches but nothing worth writting home about. The corn dish in the middle felt like a bit of a filler to make up the numbers. The Kobe beef main course was actually pretty good. Dessert was excellent.In summary, terrible start working its way towards a pretty cool finish."
Food is excellent. Fillet is mouthwatering and seafood is always fresh. Portions are big enough even for the hungriest people. Service is friendly and prices are reasonable. Great value overall.
"My partner and I dined on the Hispaniola as part of a Wowcher deal. We were really pleased with the service we received. It took a bit longer than usual to take our food order, but the waiter apologised upon realising. The food was really tasty, I had Tomato Soup for starters and Sea-Bass with roasted potatoes for my main - it was all delicious!I would highly recommend visiting this restaurant, we've decided we'll definitely be returning!"
Today I visited this place while I was around London. The place is really nice and cosy but what I really love is the service and the food. Me and my sister got the warm one to share as starter (very tasty) and beef tortellini (I love them).We got served by Sophie and Valentina (Manager) and they very attentive and friendly with customers.Great service and I will recommend this Italian restaurant to all !!!!!
"Stopped here as I was meeting some friends from Newcastle who were on their way to Portsmouth. They had all been there before but I had never even noticed it. On a Friday evening, it was always going to busy in Covent Garden but we managed to get a table and ordered. I wasn't expecting much but was really surprised at the food which was great and very cheap for it's position. The atmosphere was lively and friendly and they have bottles of house wines on special offer during happy hour - even better!Will definitely go back."
"We stopped in here for a bite as we had an offer from Groupon. The food was reasonably priced anyway, but that made it even better! The waiter/barman was excellent and very courteous and was only there when needed so that was another bonus. Good value for money and a nice place to be."
"We dined here half a decade ago or so on a cab driver's recommendation. It was superb. So on a return visit to London town we headed to Lisson Grove again. We found the same gracious unhurried service and the fish and chips remain top of our list. There is a diverse menu but this writer goes for the haddock, my wife chose plaice. One has the option of fried or grilled. Our choice was fried and the main plate was quite delectable. A side salad had an excellent combination of greens. The fish was appropriately cooked and I have more evidence that this is a mandatory stop for the fish and chips victuals.I emphasize the service is friendly and efficient. The food is worthy of a return visit. Thank you Sea Shell."
Better if you don't understand Italian.. Personal is very rude.. Good pizza but I think you can find better in other branches.
"In keeping with the wine bar downstairs, the signature cocktails upstairs mostly include wine or wine-ish ingredients somewhere in the mix. A bit on the experimental side for my taste if I'm honest, although the gin punch is rather good.Happily though there is real skill behind the bar and they can mix classics with the best of them.Seating could be more comfortable, but the service, quality, and vibe are all first class so we have become regulars."
"It was a Travelzoo deal, but so good that I wouldn't have felt cheated paying the full price. And they also do reasonable set menus pre-theatre etc.The setting could be a little too cold and modern, but the staff were perfect five star attentive and friendly without being ""in-your-face"". The food was outstandingly good - as was the cocktail that came with the deal. This is not an area that we ciome to on a regular basis, but will try to find an excuse.The whole team seem to care that the food and dining experience is good, and deserve the five star rating."
"Housed in a cobbled narrow street in Hampstead in a very quiet and quaint location that truly reminds me of the narrow small streets of Italy. The food and service is great. Very friendly staff who seem to love their job and recommend dishes when asked. The starters, mains and desserts are not to be missed. Highly recommend the crab tagliatelle and all desserts are made in house. The ice creams and sorbets are a great finale."
"I have dined here many times over the years but never reviewed it. Very little has changed over this time except the portions of steak and kidney pie, steamed meat pudding and Yorkshire puddings have reduced considerably but I appreciate our eating habits and level of consumption have changed too. The restaurant is like stepping back to a more elegant bygone age with a sumptuous stately mansion feel. We got there early so we were shown to the bar upstairs. It's relaxed and the bar manager was a top guy. He knew how to mix a cocktail alright! The display of bottles and his friendly chat was a joy. The snacks on the bar are tasty and the savoury flavours added to the nuts are made by themselves were really great and helped the drinks go down!All the staff are dressed immaculately in white shirts and aprons with black jackets and bow ties. Our service was immaculate and with a smile.We ordered crab salad to start with avocado and crisp wafers which was excellent. For main course we shared rib of beef. It was cooked to perfection with roasted shallots, spinach and Yorkshire puddings, all presented with the bone in a large copper dish to the table. We asked specially for creamed Savoy cabbage as a side dish which also came with dauphinois potatoes. Simply stunning!My dessert was apple tarte tatin which was disappointing as it looked more like a pudding and not thinly based on light pastry but tasty nevertheless.All of this was washed down with a bottle of Pouilly Fume and Fleurie which were delicious.The whole meal was not cheap but pure class costs, and totally great value.May this restaurant continue for many years more in exactly the same way as it is unique and very special. I love it and cannot recommend it highly enough.I just wish that diners would show more respect for the staff and not turn up in jeans with untucked shirts. I wouldn't let them in!!!"
"I echo the other glowing reviews, I found this place by accident and still visit often. There is a menu but you are better off just asking Tom (the eccentric chef) what he recommends that day - always a good range of irish specials, pies and other pub favourites on offer. Tom also serves the food to the Hardys pub next door so you have the choice of eating there or in the seperate restaurant."
"First time and we were disappointed. Everything smelled of fried food, even our clothes when we left. My fish was very greasy, my spouses was a bit less so.May have been an off night, but we will not test this one again."
"We Arrived at about 11.45am on a Saturday for some lunch before an afternoon tour we had booked. At this time we got a table on the main floor but those arriveing at 12pm or after had to go upstairs.The barmaid was really friendly. We ordered two different burgers - mine said 'hold the salad and pickle' on the menu so I asked her whether that meant (as I suspected) that it came without these things. She said not and that it was just the menu being a bit quirky, so I ordered it....and it came without! Luckily my boyfriends came with them and he doesn't like them, so I got them anyway in the end!The food was delicious and reasonably priced for central London (burger and fries around the £10 mark).The atmosphere was relaxed, service good (apart from small pickle issue!) and I would highly recommend it. Nice change from the chains."
The Mayfair Bar never fails to impress. It was refurbished a while ago with lovely decor. It's definitely the go to bar in Mayfair for pre dinner drinks. Great place and atmosphere.
Food was delicious and service very good. We had a sharing plate of starters to begin with and I had the salmon while my friend had the duck curry both of which was yummy. There are lots of choices to eat (glad we made the right choice) and right next door to a large shopping centre 'Westfield Centre'.
We were lucky to grab a table for 6 at the last minute as thankfully someone didn't turn up for their booking. Lucky us! We all decided to have two small plates each. Everything was delicious and filling. Couldn't fault any of it. Lovely ambience in the place and the interior was tastefully decorated. I'm looking forward to visiting again!
"Tasty food, healthy and well presented. This Jamie's restaurant is in one of the nicest places of the city and giveing us new experiences each time you visit it.Good job guys"
Gave this place another chance as it has now been open for several months and they have dropped the duo menu...curry and Turkish. Now just good old fashioned Indian curry. It is so much better. Lovely popodums with loads of dips. We had fantastic tandoori king prawns wirh chicken passanda . Lovely food. Two great side dishes of tara dalh and a vegetarian curry and being greedy a mushroom rice and garlic nan. All good and a takeaway to fed us tomorrow. Back on top as our local curry house. We will return. The refurbishment is top quality and the food is now getting there. Happy customers
I went with my family this week and I won't go back.Horrible ramen! Service unbearable - rude and grumpy manager . Don't recommend at all!
"A friend had bought us a voucher for a 4 course meal. I don't know how much it cost but, it was worth every penny. The food was superb - pan seared red mullet, Grilled Black County sirloin steak, and roasted essex lamb rump. It all tasted amazingly good. My partner was less enthused by his watercress veloute (thought he could do better....). The service was also excellent, and the delightful french waiter who brought our food to the table was charm and smiles personified. I would recommend this restaurant absolutely."
We came to tgi after a long day of travelling and shopping there was a small wait in which we got a drink and had a laugh with the bar tenders and local girls! The meal was lovely and staff very attentive even though it was really busy. The best part was when my partner realised he had left his business phone in the restaurant when we got back to the hotel we rang the immediately and the manager answered she had found the phone and put it in the safe. We were so relieved at her kindness thank you so much will definitely visit you again.
Went Sunday evening. Plenty of room for 4 people. Sat us at a table. No menu given. Came back with menu 10 mins later. Waited ages for drinks and food order to be taken. Food was good but average. Nothing out of the ordinary. No side salad/coleslaw with burger so quite unimaginative. Cleared plates. Took ages to come back with dessert menu. Took even longer to come back for order. Needed to go as kids school next day. Asked for Bill. Ages to take payment. Paid and left. No tip today I'm afraid. Wasn't even that busy in there.
"I have been to this restaurant 3 times, twice for lunch, and once for dinner. All 3 times, I absolutely loved the food and the ambiance is also very nice and intimate. It's located on London Wall, which is great for me as I work in Moorgate.Good points:1). Food is very tasty ( if you love seafood like me, I would recommend the Phad Phed Talay).2). Good location for those working in the city, also very close to Liverpool street station.3). Good ambiance.Bad Points:1). Service can be very slow. The first time I went, it was for lunch, and I went after 1pm, so the service was not so bad. However, the second time I went for lunch, I went at 12noon, and they were so busy, that even by 1pm, our food still had not Arrived, so we ended up taking the food away instead of eating in the restaurant. I must say that the customer service was not great, because considering how long they made us wait for our food, they could have offered us free drinks, prawn crackers, or something, but they did not, and were also not very apologetic. I gave them the benefit of doubt and went a this time for dinner. Again, I can't fault the food, but the service was very slow and considering that this time, they were not busy at all, there was no excuse. They took so long to take our food order, and even when they did, I had to call the waitress over, before she actually took our order. When they brought our drinks, I asked for a straw, and she said she would get it, however, she didn't. When they brought our food, I asked for a straw again, and told her that I had asked a while ago, but again, she didn't bring it. I had to then alert another waiter, before finally getting the straw. They are not very proactive in the way they serve, they are more reactive and wait for you to ask for something before they offer you, and even when you ask them, they either forget altogether, or take long to bring what you requested. They are not rude, at least not when ive been there, but they need to work on the speed of their service and also how much attention their waiters pay to requests made by customers.2). They are only open Monday-Friday, however, this is the case for most restaurants in the city because I guess its not worth opening on the weekends, so can't fault them for this.I would recommend this restaurant, but they need to work on their service. Good food though!"
"It us well made, i have been to different Egyptian places here, i think its is advantage is that it is an easy meal to go, the service is quick"
"Really fresh ingredients with lovely authentic flavours. My boyfriend who is a very fussy eater is now converted and loved the miso soup, yakitori and cucumber sushi (can't remember the official name) the service was un-intrusive but efficient there was certainly no racism involved. The restaurant is small but calm and there were Japanese people eating a variety of foods (I always think this is a good sign) I enjoyed a aubergine dish which was really tasty and then a selection of sushi including tuna, turbot and salon. The fish was amazing and so tender. We didn't have deserts as we were full after our mains, however we had a drink in the bar area which was a lovely end to our meal. Look forward to a revisit."
"This fast-food counter is set inside a large food court in the shopping centre. There is no table service except for the cleaning ladies eagerly trying to take away finished plates.I paid for a bottle of white wine and was later told they sold out. All they could offer is a bottle of Prosecco and they asked that I pay the difference. They do not have flutes. It was barely cold enough so I had to ask for ice in a ceramic bowl from the counter next door. Typical London service, typical London attitude.Pizza was OK, tasted a bit more burnt underneath than other branches but not overly so.I definitely would not visit this branch again. The branch at Liverpool St is much more serene."
"over priced, rude staff, food was not very good, coffee very strong even after we asked for more milk, very unhelpful staff"
We ate as a group of 6 before heading off for a show. The service was a little slow but food and drinks enjoyed by all. Lovely cocktails!
"Food here was absolutely amazing and very tasty, prices were good, portion sizes were perfect, staff were very friendly and helpful. Would recommend 100%"
"I can't wait to return. Lovely staff, gorgeous food,beautiful cocktails what else could you asked for. The sticky toffee pudding is to die for."
"We've been here three or four times now. Last night was exceptional. The organisation isn't faultless (several groups Arrived at once at 9 ) but suitability apologetic. The food was glorious. Sweet pea and rosemary soup, asparagus and ox cheek starters then trout and lamb main courses - but inventive combinations and intense tastes. I just hope Otis (the chef) stays awhile in our neighbourhood and doesn't disappear to grander areas."
"I moved to the area in April and have been going to the starting gate regularly since then, the food is super, especially their sunday roast deal. Their craft beer tap is always changing and they have a loyalty stamp card meaning every 7 pint is free, which is pretty excellent. Last night I was there and my bag got stolen through no fault of the staff, I left it at my table and a woman went off with it. The staff went reported it to the police immediately, checked CCTV and found the bag but obviously with stuff missing in the toilets, the bartenders notified me, actually went so far as to follow the woman when they saw her on their way home and was generally just amazing in helping me with this. I'm so happy this is my local pub and that the bartenders look after their guests like they do."
"Sunday late afternoon, we popped into this compact and open air restaurant in the heart of Covent garden for a very quick bite!Thankfully, we didn't have to queue and were quickly seated at one of their high tables in the centre of the dining area. The edges of this quaint and homely looking restaurant have more conventional seating with rather interesting looking heating controls for heating your seat or your feet as it is, after all, outdoors! It is a novel and quirky touch We told the waiter we had thirty minutes to eat. He immediately suggested the menu items that would allow us to order in that time frame. He took the lead and we followed. We ordered everything he suggested. The service was great! The drinks Arrived straight away followed minutes later by the food ordered. The food was truly delicious. Fish and chips with mushy peas - diveine. The pizza was beautiful. Really great. Cannot recommend it highly enough. This is a tourist attraction for all those people who love Jamie Oliver however it is also a quality little eatery with great service standards and above all - great tasting food. Looking forward to the next time already."
"Dinner for 4 on the occasion of my birthday in December. As you would hope from a restaurant in this location, the service was faultless and the food as good as it always in a Cote Brasserie.I had steak tartare followed by sea bass which were both excellent. My dessert then came with a side-order of embarrassment as my girlfriend decided to tell them it was my birthday. They stuck a candle in my cheese(!) and ALL the waiting staff came and sang ""happy birthday"". Grrrr!!!!"
This small bar is just of the main hustle and bustle of Covent Garden and is perfect to grab something to eatWhile your there. It's mainly simple fare but couldn't grumble at my bourbon sauce burger although the fries could of been hotter they were fine. A couple of half price cocktails on a Sunday rounded off my meal
"The meal was ok, nothing special, but the place was clearly too popular for its own good. We had booked well in advance, asked for a nice table to celebrate our wedding anniversary, but were given what looked like a tiny 'punishment table' along the busy path. Far too crowded and noisy for a romantic dinner. When settling the bill the restaurant had already proactively added 12.5% tip on the entire bill, including wine. It's just not worth those high prices."
"We recently took clients to Stamford Bridge to watch Chelsea play the mighty Man United, and opted to book a pre match table at Marco's.........the decor was simple, but impressive, and we were warmly welcomed on arriveal.....the pre match set menu offered a good choice, catering for most tastes (steak, lobster, chicken, cod) and delivered on both presentation and taste........the service was excellent, and we left satisfied with our choice......I would certainly recommend this place on match day....."
"Only went in because every other place around was close and it was late. Even though I was hungry, I could not stop thinking how bad it was. It is not terrible, but I believe the pizzas from the supermarket made in my oven taste better than these."
"I live outside Vancouver, BC we have some of the best Dim Sum in the world. This place was very very good. We tried many dishes and had 2 noodle dishes. All the food was very tasty. This places is just down from Seafresh and About Thyme Bistro"
"The food is tasty and often refreshingly different but I have noticed a trend of some waiters displaying an alarming lack of self assurance, knowledge and customer care - regarding the menu, listening skills and the expectations of guests. Not everyone who visits the restaurant is a tourist who may never come back!"
Delighted to find this open for a late afternoon light meal.Exactly what we needed after a hectic day at Chelsea .Perfect service and great charcuterie.We shared a plate of meats and pates .Would recommend .Several people were eating burgers -which come highly rated.
"We had a website offer but we were treated very well. The food and service was excellent, true, the restaurant was not busy as we ate early evening, but everything was served well and tasted very good. Our waiter and waitress were charming and friendly. Lovely restaurant spiled only by the taped music, not necesary when there are other people eating, there is a natural buzz. Certainly would visit again, with or without the offer."
"This is a very nice ol school pub that serves good beers and bitters, you can watch footie here and all the staff are so lovely. Booze is also very reasonably priced."
"On arriveal we were told there was a 30 minute wait for a table, no problem, we'll have a drink at the bar. 25 minutes later we were still waiting to be served a drink at the bar. An hour after that we were still standing at the bar. Will NEVER go back. Appalling service and no apology."
"A very nice Ux At the heart of Chelsea and its football club premises stands Marco Grill Quiet and relaxing atmosphere Very welcoming attitude on the spot Menu card is limited, which we know today stands for quality ( and it does here ) Fantastically simple Crab tartine to start with ,Sirloin steak juicy , tasty and cooked to perfection Side orders has amazing brocollis"
"As other reviewers have observed, this restaurant is located in an unassuming local area without any pretension whatsoever ....but the food and service are sensational and justify the effort. If you like Asian food and are prepared to concentrate on the food rather than the glitz, then this venue ticks all of the boxes."
"We had dinner there and got a table after lining up for 2 minutes around 6:30pm. Appetizers were in really small portions that you may leave an impression that the owners are quite mean. We had Beetroot salad, trout terrine and Bloody Mary Mussels. All of them were well seasoned and tasted wonderful.The sizes of the main course dishes were however very substantial. Pork belly was roasted to perfection and meat was tender. Lamb chop was slightly overcooked but tasted good. The roast chicken was a success: succulent meat mixed well with the salad and the curry new potatoes on the side.We tried sticky toffee pudding and Black Forest gateau, and both of them were not particularly impressive and you may skip them.The central location, friendly atmosphere and the street performers in show right in front of this restaurant are its trump cards. Food are not impressive but not expensive either. We may come back again if we don't need to queue for a seat."
It has been ages since I came here and Im pleased to say they still do the best Cote de Boeuf ive ever tasted. My wife had the Lobster and she loved it. Liked the background Jazz but could hardly hear it which was a shame.
"I thought I'd been to some good Indian restaurants ... until I visited Dishoom, which takes Indian food to another level. The best Indian food ive ever had - lots of stunning little dishes of absolutely perfect flavour. The staff were really knowledgeable and helpful so we ended up with just gorgeous food that we all loved. Great atmosphere, lovely and busy and buzzy. Couldn't fault anything!"
"My daughter booked us in for a pre-theatre meal yesterday and it was fabulous. Steak cooked to perfection and a mille feuille that was devine, Lovely service and interesting surroundings. Will be heading here to eat the next time I visit London."
This is for sure the best Lebanese Restaurant in London. We ordered the mezze and enjoyed every dish. We went there with extended family and friends. About 20 people of which 7 were kids. It is not pretentious but still has a great atmosphere. The kids enjoyed themselves as there was a table at the back of the restaurant were they were allowed to play so us adults could relax too. We had different mains of which all were great but especially the slow cooked lamb is to die for. Wonderful service and it is very clean. Food Hygiene rating is 5!The entire evening was great and we will come back for sure.
Classic restaurant con: I went to Goya for lunch today. Asked for a small glass of wine. It came but still seemed quite large and I could only manage half of it. When the bill came I asked if it was a small glass and they said no it was large. When I said I asked for a small glass the waiter angrily told me that I would have to pay for a large glass since I didn't send it back immediately. He became very rude and suggested that I had deliberately tried to pay for a small glass while drinking a large glass. Considering the half full glass was standing on the table his argument was clearly rubbish and he was trying intimidation tactics. I will not return.
The portions had shrunk since our last visit and we noticed that our discount voucher was not fully honoured until we complained. Check your bills. Won't be going again.
"I have been to The ivey in Covent Garden and Dubai before so knew their food/drinks are pretty good.We had the set menu as we ordered before 6pm so it is good value. Two courses for £16.50 or three courses for £21.I had the steak main which has a £3.50 supplement. It wasn't a great cut of meat and the salad was dirty and dead!Would go again but probably eat from the a la carte.Also, we were told 5:30pm was the latest table we could have-the restaurant was empty and there were loads of tables so not sure why a 6pm one wouldn't of been ok?!"
"This should be seen as an ideal find in the City. Another wee gem that rewards a search.The atmosphere is good, as is the selection of drinks.But while sitting in a booth, waiting for my friends to arrive, one of the staff came up and dropped down a note stating that the table was now reserved from 6:30 - less than an hour from now.I enquired as to how a table that was occupied could suddenly be reserved (meaning the occupiers would have to leave), and the curt reply was simply that someone else had paid to reserve it. And was my drink free? Or was there any way in which I could have known to reserve a table that appeared to be free? No.I don't live in the UK anymore, but I hope that rules like this never become the norm."
"My sister and I visited pitt cue on a Monday. We were recommended by a friend of ours and we were not let down! Having read some other reviews, we must have been lucky as we were sat down straight away. The menu is interesting too! Bone marrow mash and pigs head sausage! I opted for the pulled pork and broccoli side. Both mine and my sisters meals were delicious!Such a cool place however be warned it is very ""manly"" I loved it though and will definitely be returnin with my boyfriend soon!"
"ive been to this branch quite a few times, and every meal ive had here has been excellent. Food is always served warm and there are decent choices for vegetarians. A few dishes can be tailored for vegan diets.The dessert menu has a good range of dishes - the cheesecakes in particular are delicious. Waiting times to be seated and for food are reasonably quick. The servers here have always been friendly, courteous, and ensure our food is of good quality. One server even asked if we wanted to use a discount code when she got our bill for us, which has never happened to me before!I'm not sure why this place has so many poor reviews - although every time ive been here, the restaurant is quiet so maybe that is linked to the attentive service we've received."
"We needed coffee mid morning and entered Strada, never having been in one before. The coffee was excellent, strong, full flavoured and a decent size. We didnt eat but were presented with a £10 voucher off a meal for two. Intend to use it!"
"Very clean, great aesthetic, food is delicious and lots of selection, impressed! Not much room to eat in but still great!"
We waited for a tour but it poured down at the start and we had to abandon the tour. The Crown Jewels absolutely stunning.
Byron has great burgers and fries and kids options in a kid central location. The children's options are great - not many places around offer Mac n cheese with veg and French fries and ice cream all while the adults can chat and have a glass of wine. They are open fairly late as well. Skip the onion rings. Try the adult milk shakes!
"We have been here a couple of times in recent days. Over the Xmas/new year period, this place was open when many others in the vicinity were closed. It was always busy. Good service but food was a bit hit and miss. Good dim sum and beef rendang but the green curry was disappointing. Good kids' menu."
"My wife and I, and another couple, went one warm Saturday evening in late June, hoping for an authentic and relaxing experience. What we got was pretty bland food, and a very irritating waiter/Maitre d'. The food was very disappointing. My wife has a passion for good French Onion Soup, but it was awful. It was like dishwater with a piece of soggy bread floating on the top. For a French restaurant to produce French Onion Soup that bad is unforgiveable. The mains were equally poor. The service was truly dreadful! OK, the food Arrived reasonably efficiently, but the Maitre d' just would not shut up! We were treated to a constant barrage of his ""witty"" comments, and he actually interrupted our conversation, on several occasions, to add what he thought were ""amusing"" observations. If we'd wanted a fifth dinner guest we'd have invited one!Overall we didn't enjoy the experience at all."
"The first time in 2 years since being gluten and lactose free I managed to go somewhere where there is more than 2 things on the menu I can choose - in fact a WHOLE menu I can eat - absolute heaven. And to top that - it was very delicious indeed.My Partner does not have these issues but loved it as much and agreed he would not know the difference at all - the only thing he would have known is the bread was lighter than normal - but it was the best Gluten free we've had.I had a marvellous soup to start, fish and chips for main (I have missed this so much I had to) and it was so crispy and an amazing chocolate pud with almond ice cream to finish - I was already full, but as pudding is usually a non even for me I had to try. My partner had different dishes and let me taste - they were all great too, especially the monk fish.Glad to say the next day my tummy is still happy and so therefore am I - cannot wait to visit and try the rest of the menu soon.Staff were lovely, atmosphere great, some areas quieter if you wanted and comfortable seating too which was a bonus after a long day out in London."
"I use to go there for a quick meal or for an ice cream with my family. Is a nice place, with a buffet on the counter and an ice cream shop. In summer is the best time, to enjoy the sunshine."
"We ate lunch at various locations of Pret a Manger in London and always found them to be a nice, healthy, less expensive alternative. But note that there are no washrooms in these restaurants."
"Originally a Christian Evangelical place of worship, now a community art centre offering food and drink. Not far from Portobello but an oasis of calm, certainly when we visited. Large tree lined frontage with tables dotted around and further seating inside. The place had a relaxing vibe with jazz playing in the background and West Indian influences. We had some nice coffee and also ordered some pancakes. However, after quite a long wait they hadn't Arrived so we did not get to sample the food. Hence the average rating. We will return in the future as some items on the menu looked interesting and hopefully by then the food service will have speeded up."
"Sat outside as such lovely day, I don't think the staff really knew what was going on. Service was slow. But food was reasonably prices and of a good standard."
"Great place, great food, great service, good ambiance! Evening dinner - superb food - great menu and fine wines to accompany the dishes. Wonderful treat whilst staying at the Levin - highly recommend it! Sorry for delay in posting this!"
"Food is delicious, staff are courteous, attentive, warm and friendly. Everything about the place was spot on... The food though! Refer to the image attached. Just astoundingly delicious. Will most definently come here again."
I am a regular takeaway person due to the fact that i cannot cook. However. My in-ability to cook does not my effect my taste buds. The food looked well presented and well packaged. When opened we was amazed and excited. Maybe the excitement was too overwhelming because the food was a big let down. The lemongrass beef was chunky and was not even your average taste. The pho was sweet which is wrong because vietnamese pho is actually savoury. I dont knw how other people reviewed the food. Because it just did not taste appetising at all. But 10/10
"Having visited last year after a long time we were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food and service, however returning this month we were very disappointed. The restaurant appeared to have been taken over. A large gentleman was patrolling the restaurant as if he owned it ( maybe he did) however whilst he spoke to some people he never ventured near us. The food was quite average I had veal escalope and spinach which was fine though the meal was spoilt by live loud music which didn't add anything to the ambiance and made conversation difficult"
"We held a leaving do for a colleague here upstairs in the dining room. We ordered a few sharing platters, nachos, chips etc, all were good. The service was really good, as soon as we finished a bottle of wine another appeared. Will definitely be back!"
"A quality establishment not too far from Brick Lane. It's own beers are fine, but they need a few guest beers Great sitting outside when the westher is good Food is good, but the smell of the brewery puts me off eating there."
"The little wait that you may endure on a busy evening is worth it. The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is cozy and the food is a perfect balance of generosity and deliciousness. We've been there 3 times and we've always enjoyed it. The menus are very good value and are a perfect introduction to Eritrean/Ethiopian cuisine. The pop corn with the coffee at the end of the meal is really not necessary but happily eaten!"
Me & my mother ate at this restaurant on 29th Dec 2012 before we went to see a 2:30pm show at the Savoy Theater (which is 2mins walk away). From the outside it looks like a very small restaurant but inside & downstairs there is a much bigger dining area. We had a table at the first level of the restaurant. The food was absolutly lovey & the wine very reasonable (it's £6.75 a glass in the theater so wine at £4.25 & £4.70 i think was reasonable). We had the 2 course set Prezzo Fisso meals at £9.95 each & they were both very nice. Mum had the pasta & I the pizza which was big. The staff were extreamly friendley & very helpful. Our waitress was Erika and she was most helpful & very polite.I would recommend this restaurant to others seeking a nice treat before the theater or even as a break form shopping.
"After being unable to get a table in our hotel's restaurant we set off into the night and along London bridge road to find somewhere that we could eat as a family of 4 adults and 3 children (8, 5 and 1) After trying a few places that only allowed children in until 7pm we weren't expecting much from this restaurant. We all had a lovely meal and the staff were all very helpful and friendly. The children had a 3 course meal for a set price which had very good sized portions and they thoroughly enjoyed them. Would definitely recommend and would go back."
"Fumo is part of the San Carlo Group apparently, which includes Cicchetti. And you can see they are still improving on their formula. The restaurant specializes in cicchetti, the Italian version of tapas, and the dishes were flavoursome and differentiated. We had about eight dishes and a bottle of wine and with service it was about £80. The service is extremely attentive without being obtrusive and the new refurbishment of the venue is delightful. I asked about a party room, thinking it would be a nice venue for a priveate group / business dinner but alas, they haven't one. Close to the theatres, it would be a treat for a show, but I went in after a quick visit to the National Gallery on a weekend and was able to sit without a table booking."
"Excellent food, Friendly ambience. It is a neighborhood restaurant which I would make the effort of visiting. Great All Day Dining. All the ingredients are fresh and procured with love."
"2 adult 1 child. 1 adult and child meals of chicken fajitas ok, other adult meal of king prawn and crispy noodles- not so much crispy but a soggy mess with cold, stiff, burnt prawns. Attentive serving staff made up as bestie they could and offered refund on bill + free of charge replacement. Just went for starters while others ate dessert. 10 out of 10 for Servers, 0 for Cook."
Amazing food one of the best places to eat! Food is scrumptious and pure fruit juices too . Good value for money.
"I'm fortunate to have visited Bar Boulud for both lunch and dinner in recent weeks. I cannot fault the menu nor the wine list. On each occasion I have ordered one of their excellent burgers and also had fantastic oysters. I can't fault either the service, nor the food and wine. My only comment might be the tables in the back seemed quite close together and if you can opt for a table in the front half."
"Great service, great food and reasonable prices! Especially try out one of the cocktails or the fish 'n' chips! Highly recommend this one!"
Had wonderful meal here for Mothers' Day. Owner was attentive and welcoming and food was definitely a cut above Lebanese ive had before. Highly recommended.
"I enjoyed a meal here recently with some friends, and mist say it's my new favourite Restaurant.Arrived st 7.30 in a Friday night and the place had a Great buzz,outside seating basement bar and Restaurant all full, service was good and fast considering the amount if covers.The food and drink were both really really tasty, and the great thing with Tapas is you can just keep ordering as you wish:)We were the last to leave this Gorgeous little Restaurant and would definitely make a beeline the next time I'm in the area."
"Further to my sparkling review of May 2013, the service in this place has taken a saddening nose-dive. Surly, sullen, moody waiting and bar staff. The food was good, but the attitude of two of the three staff made my entire party feel uncomfortable. I'd go as far as to say it spoiled the evening. I notice other reviews have made mention of moody staff, so I fear mine was not an isolated incident."
"Fresh product, nice selection, very tasty soups and sandwiches. Never disappointed with any product from this company."
"Our family stumbled upon this after a tour. The atmosphere is neat--soaring glass windows for good people watching and lots of interesting details my kids liked. The pizza was good, though nothing special. My husband's Indian spiced chicken was tasty though. Kids liked the fish fingers, though the heap of tartar sauce on top was not appreciated by the kiddos. The ice cream was great!"
"Read great reviews about this restaurant but a very surly waiter showed us to our table. He was obviously sick and coughed and sneezed into his hand and constrantly blew his nose. Not once did I see him wash his hands but continued to serve drinks, food, etc. We were disgusted and would never eat here again. Food was just ""okay""."
"Really enjoyed our meal , and wow what a view. We had a window seat that looked straight across to the Millennium Wheel. The food was delish , wine excellent and service very good. Had a lovely evening and most certainly will go back."
"Visited yesterday pre theatre , very slow and poor service , don't go unless you got all day ! Poor service from youngsters who don't care , sticky tables and tables not cleaned ! Waited ages then food came was Luke warm grrr ate n went as was going to be late for our show !!!Don't bother !!"
"I visited the restaurant and I was taken apart from the long queue, so I went inside and counted 22 empty seats. I called the managera nd I asked them why people have to wait for so long, outside, while inside there were 22 seats empty.They tried to explain to me how the place is run and that it takes time to turn the tables over. Frankly speaking, the restaurant is not run well OR the management gives them instructions to create queues purposly. Fot the food, I do not have much to say, BUSABA is great with some very tasty dishes. I prefer the healthy dishes and the tea with lemongrass. If you do not like spicy food make sure you tell them in advance."
"Went here on a friday night and had the steak, it was perfectly cooked. I would recommend this restaurant, the food was very good and the service was ok."
"Wanted to like it here as we were pleased that a fish & chip shop had opened after the last remaining one closed down on Berwick St .Can't fault the quality - good potato & decent fresh fish but ......We both left hungry having had the regular cod & chips , come on guys - put something on the plate ! I know it's central London & rents are high but tight portion on the fish & very tight on the chips -- how much more for another spud...Glad I had a roll & butter to fill me up .£33 for two with sparkling water , if you want a large you're going to end up paying over £40 with drinks & no sides ... Left feeling disappointed......"
"Who doesn't like a proper grill cheese sandwich? And these are good. Very good. Small menu selection, which is what you want and in my view a very good thing. But what would have earned it the full five green dots would be, a chilli sauce option and grilled onions rather than raw. Wont stop be going back but though."
"I have now visited this little Pearl of a cafe on 3 occasions. This last time we got there 30 mins before opening and the owner, not only opened up he made us the most awesome English, Full English.When at the Excell or surrounding locations, book room only and go to Bonnane.You will not be disappointed."
"We visited Bella Italia on the Strand in London. The one in Covent Gardens was full and people were queuing outside waiting for a free table.We chose Bella Italia as it offered Gluten Free food options and also a kids menu.When we Arrived, the waiter said that there were tables downstairs' and directed to the stairs and shouted down our arriveal, though after a minute of standing at the bottom and not being acknowledged, we decided to pick a table and sit down. It took 5 minutes before a waitress came over and realised that we had sat in the wrong area, so we had to move which was unsettling, especially when you have grumpy kids in tow!Our new waitress was very friendly and helped us settle in. Our table was directly below an air conditioning unit and it was freezing, she very kindly turned it down and made sure that we were fine though our stay. She also checked on the gluten ingredients on one of the meals listed on the specials board.Our food was lovely and the kids were kept entertained with colouring and puzzles at the back of their menus.I simply enjoyed the fact that I could eat Gluten free garlic bread. Our bill came in at around £44 for the four of us. The kid's meal deal is great value for money and the kids loved their food too.We would definitely come again."
"I know the first thought on your mind.. who am I to say that Seashells is the best fish and chips in London? Well, let's just say that I have done 'em all! I have scoured the best in London from Geales (good but too pretentious) to Golden Hind (probably no. 2) to Nautilus (great fish but a nightmare to get to..).. You name it, ive been there and chomped at everything from cod to plaice!!So, yes, I do know what I am talking about, and Seashells is simply the best (as that Tina Turner song goes..).The location and decor are nothing to write home about.. if you eat in, it's basic inside, even with the new post fire decor (Seashells was burnt down last year). There's not much ambience but then again, that's not what you come for right? Service is pretty fast (superb Eastern European service!) and food is perfect! Last I was there, I ordered a plaice and it was so fresh that the natural juices oozed out when I cut in through the crispy batter. Chips were good and mushy peas tasty. There was also limited amount of grease so you can eat a touch more comfortably! All in all, fresh, tasty, and the real McCoy! (in Brit slang that means, the real deal or simply.. real English food!).You can also take away and eat on the roadside on make-shfit tables. This is a great alternative. Not only do you get a larger selection of traditional chip shop grub (such as Cod Roe, Scampi and Battered Sausages) but the prices are half those in the restaurant! It's an efficiently run take away counter complete with a pile of fresh lemon slices to accompany your fish. My only complain is the egg carton eat-out trays which make the fish batter soggy in a nano-second.. maybe better to use good ole newspaper?..So there you have it.. THE best fish n chip shop in London.. maybe even in the UK? And I know.. cos I am also a chef!"
"Given the prices you pay, this is just an excellent place to drop in for breakfast, or coffee. Very nice & pleasant people too."
"Had dinner in the igloos last night, fortunately we had a reservation as the group in front of us were told it was a 4hr wait for walk-ins, and that was at 6pm! Staff all very friendly and helpful, especially Rita our waitress. The food was very good for the price, and came remarkably quickly. Definitely worth a visit."
We visited this restaurant during its first few weeks. The menu is interesting and we tried all the starters on the menu. The dishes were fresh and delicious. The atmosphere is nice and the service was good. The food is good quality with prices to match.
"My wife and I had just Arrived in town from the US and were somewhat jet lagged and a little hungry. The Kings Head Pub (where the Broadway Bar and Grill is located) was just around the corner from our Barclay Road B&B so it was an obvious choice - particularly as I was also ready for a beer or two; just to settle in!Lunch was over (well it was rather late in the afternoon) but the kitchen team rustled us up some burgers and chips that were delightful. These guys could have just said ""No! Kitchen's closed"" which in my prior experience in London would be a standard line but they obviously recognised our need and went out of their way to accommodate us.The burgers tasted great and the servings were huge (in fact we didn't eat dinner) and more importantly the beer was wet and tasty!We headed back to the Kings Head after a Chelsea V Newcastle United game just down the road at Stamford Bridge a few days later. The mood was a little more upbeat and the crowd somewhat more vocal (Chelsea victory) but the beer was still wet and just as tasty!!"
"We were in the area and decided to stop here for lunch and a dessert for our 2nd year wedding anniversary. When we walked in we were warmly greeted and showed to our seats. We waited around 15 minutes before anyone even came near us to ask for a menu, and when I asked for a menu the waitress gave me one and had to go in search of another one for my husband. Not good service, especially on a special occasion. We ordered sandwiches for lunch I had a vegetarian sandwich and my husband has a smoked salmon sandwich. The sandwiches were lovely, but its the first place I have ever visited that a vegetarian sandwich was £4 dearer than a salmon sandwich! I think i must have paid extra for the piece of plastic cling film I found in the salad that came with my sandwich...I told the waitress of the plastic cling film in my salad and she apologised and said she would inform the chef, however I thought that some of the bill would have been reduced as I could not eat all of my meal due to the plastic cling film found in it as a gesture of goodwill, but no there was nothing off it. Over all the service was not good. A disappointing wedding anniversary lunch. I would not recommend this place or visit again."
Great! Meat delicious and great quality! Staff was nice not always having the answer but made sur Ì_e they check
My wife & I took afternoon tea on the Hispaniola. It was very poor. The sandwiches were uninspiring and were of limited choice. The cakes were dry & nothing special. The only high light were the scones which were lovely with jam & lotted cream. The staff were pleasant but slow & the service was shambolic. People who Arrived after us got a pot of tea before us. I ordered coffee which I then received whilst my wife waited a long time & only when we reminded them for the second time did a pot of tea arrive. The whole experience was a disappointment which I wouldn't repeat. The boat is very tired with dated decor. The toilets are something out of the 60's.There are far better venues for an afternoon tea in central London.
"Me and my partner went there for lunch and as always the food was amazing. There was shorter blond gentleman there who served us and he was delightful, friendly polite and definitely an asset to your company. We later on returned for some cocktails and the guy behind the bar was also unbelievable, great work guys."
"Bala Baya is becoming my new favourite restaurant! We've been there twice and both times adored the food - such as the crispy crunchy chicken, lamb and dumplings, calamari, ox and chickpeas. Delicious!! The plates are perfect for sharing, and the cocktails are awesome too. The place is pretty big but do book as it gets busy. We like to sit at the bar because the staff are so amazing! Have heard that the brunch is to die for - must try it next."
"The ambience and service at Kaspar's was very good on our most recent visit. Drinks Arrived quickly and top ups were always timely and made without having to request them. All members of staff were knowledgeable of the menu.Niggles though included a seemingly unnecessary delay before being seated while some keyboard tapping went off at the maitre'd desk; having to fiddle with the seal on the miniature tabasco bottle that came with the oysters (please pre-open this, ive bought it regardless of whether I choose to use it); and some kind of under sweetened apple tart that was advised on the menu as being tarte tatin. Tarte tatin is a thing, not something needing reinvention. Overall experience still good though and I'll be back for more."
"My husband and I ate here one evening after work, you cannot book a table in the evening so got there early as we didn't want to queue. We got seated right by the till and where the waiting staff stand to put in customers orders so not the best place as we felt the table move each time. Room was very tight and tables very close to each other, there was no other table available apart from one that seated four people which I would of preferred to sit at but we were told we couldn't then we saw the next couple come and and sit there! It did annoy me a bit. The food was very nice and good quality and the waiter did help us with our choices we took his advice but his suggestions were a bit random. We found we had spent quite a bit of money in a short space of time. If we had stayed longer we would of spent a small fortune. As we left there was a queue out of the door so a popular place."
"Great burgers and good level of service quite close to the Covent Garden underground station. I wish, there would be more similar burger joints available in Helsinki as well in addition to the lower quality fast food burgers."
"Was visiting London Tower Bridge area for a couple of days. First evg realized many dt restos close 9pm for dins so started searching and wanted to try Chinatown. Came across this based on rating so called to confirm their kitchen was still open as it was 10pm - yes. Ok, Doubletree advised that we are sending a client by taxi.I arrive around 20 mins later and door is locked with 3 Asian folks chatting. One Lady opened and I explained who i was - reluctantly opened and seated me. I was the only one there but was set on eating something quick as it was late - and not about to search for another one.Picked out 3 items upon some discussion with the same Lady - who clearly was an owner. All the while I was deciding and then when the drinks came, there is all this discussion in Asian of course, glances over and over. Immediately after ordering, the first dish came out lukewarm as if it was just sitting around. Small bowl of white rice to follow - then 5 mins later a sizzling dish. Food was decent but not anywhere great.Back to the talking in Asian - kept on going then I catch them taking a picture of me - and they were then shocked when I said whats that for - oh oh, just sending them to my manager to show we are still here. 20 mins later, a guy walks in, kisses the lady, more foreign talk before he leaves. Remember the Seinfeld episode when Elaine was getting her nails done and the ladies were all talking about her but in Chinese - before George's dad comes to help as he can speak Chinese. Anyways, exactly that.Either way, food was avg, service was weird and off - hence I would not recommend this place simply because there are plenty of options nearby presuming you do a little more advance checking than I did."
"My wife and I visited this restaurant with four friends for a second time - the last time being about a year ago. Suffice it to say that the food and service were, once again, amongst the best that we have experienced anywhere. The restaurant, which is part of the Royal Garden Hotel, is situated close to Kensington High Street tube station.Food was beautifully prepared and presented. I always say that the best chefs have the knack of providing food in quantities that are neither too little nor too large - hence when you leave you don't feel the need to find the nearest chip shop (!) nor are you left feeling bloated. Certainly, the Park Terrace achieves this. Of course, if you have an enormous appetite then maybe this is not the place for you but in my experience the meals will suit the vast majority of people.The service provided by all staff was faultless - they are all smartly dressed and obviously well trained and friendly. Our greeting by the manageress was very warm and welcoming and the cocktail barman was also a delight (and good to watch as he prepared our pre dinner drinks). Waiters were efficient, friendly but not overbearing. The restaurant was revamped earlier this year (not that there was anything wrong with it before) and is very nicely appointed indeed. Loos are spotlessly clean.We had taken advantage of one of the restaurant's promotional vouchers which provided pre dinner cocktails, a four course meal (including cheese) and coffee for £59 per couple; the menu provides for an excellent choice. That is amazing value (the cocktails alone would have cost about £20). Even had the price been double that I would have said that it was good value. We have eaten at some other very good restaurants in London where it is quite easy to spend considerably in excess of £100 a head on a meal and this restaurant's offerings were certainly on a par with those more expensive options. The fact that we were on the voucher deal did not affect staff attitudes one iota.Wine is quite expensive (eg a Chilean Sauvignon Blanc is about £34 a bottle) but given the deal that we had it still made the final bill very acceptable.Well recommended and we shall certainly go back."
Had breakfast and dinner here on a recent tip to Lomdon. The food was lovely and the service was great. Would definitely visit again.
Me and my wife had decided to go out for a meal and on to the cinema and after being told there would be a 45min wait in the Harvester we decided to find somewhere else to eat. We stumbled across this restaurant and how glad we are that we did! The manager told us he had a table just paying the bill and we could wait in the bar for a couple of minutes. Once seated we had the scallops and the bruschetta for starters which were very nice. The waitress then reccommended a meal to me which was fabulous. It was a sirloin steak with mushrooms olives red wine sauce Sauteed potatoes and asparagus. My wife had the pizza. We were both very happy with the food and the service was excellent. The owner in particular was an absolute delight. He was very accommodating and had mastered the art of checking on you with pestering. In short we will definately be going back and hopefully bringing friends with us. Great Food. Great Service. Great Value!
"First time I went I wasnt 100% convinced, but this time it was really as expected. The prawns we had as a starter were delicious, great quality and soft, with a nice and simple spicy sauce, and the steak we had was great. Service is impeccable too, want to find something to criticize ? The french fries could be a little bit crispier, but all in all a place worth going, at a very fair price !"
"We had lunch in this gastropub with my wife and three kids and no one was disappointed! The pub itself is very comfortable in a trendy way and warm, perfect for a meal during Xmas season and the staff was very friendly. And the food was fantastic! We had the charcoal grilled cauliflower and the treacle cured salmon for starters, both were equally delicious. I then had the pork belly which was very good. As well as the steak and chips and the pie chosen by my daughters. Keep some room for the deserts: a special mention for the sticky bourbon toffee pudding!"
Went here on following nights - service very good. Food was pizza with side dishes again both served piping hot and pizza full of flavour. Second night they gave me a free limoncello as an apertif- which was a nice gesture.All in all a very nice dining experience and when in the area again I will be back!.
"Returning to our hotel after a theatre trip it took 15 minutes to attract they eye of a drinks waiter. Bar was quiet. One group had ordered cocktails. One barman making, other two staff busy chatting rather than working the floor. Could do better"
"Very tasty Italian food. Starters were small and delicate, but delicious. I had the chopped liver crostini, which was fully flavoured and the bread was nicely crusty and fresh.The main course was also small in size, I had the rabbit racy gnocchi, the gnocchi was beautifully soft and puffy and the rabbit was tender with a little chewyness. Yummy tomato based sauce, but not enough for a big eater.Good food, but if you want a big meal you will have to spend a lot."
"As my Japanese mother put it: ""This is not authentic Japanese food, but it's very nice."" She also praised the very friendly service which I have to agree on.I dine regularly at Wagamama because the service is quick, friendly and the food is always good. The dishes are served fresh once prepared, which means that everyone gets their dishes at different times, but it means your dish is always fresh and hot. My favourite main dish recently has been the Miso Noodle Soup which is slightly spicy and very big, so it will fill you even when you're at your hungriest. It's also perfect for warming you up on these cold winter evenings. But I have also enjoyed the Chicken Katsu and Yakisoba on separate occasions. The specials are also great value for money. I praise the service at Wagamama, because it's consistently professional and friendly. On my first visit, they asked me what I thought of my meal. I had big praise for the main dish but was honest about my starter, which I thought was an odd combination of flavours and I didn't enjoy. It wasn't meant as a complaint, I reassured her that I enjoyed my meal nonetheless, but when I received the bill, she had removed the unsatisfactory dish from my bill. I was very pleasantly suprised so I left the amount for this dish as a tip instead. Whilst I don't expectt this all the time, it did show that customer's enjoyment is important to them. I go at least twice a month ever since then."
"I hosted a client here for lunch and found this restaurant, if you could call it that, to be highly disorganized and disappointing. After confirming the reservation multiple times, I Arrived at the restaurant to find it half-empty, with no large tables or seating areas set up for our party of 11. I told the maitre'd (which was just the waiter) that we had Arrived, and he seemed clueless as to who we were or that we had a reservation. He then told me that their reservation system was down so they had no means of knowing who had called to reserve a table. I told him I had just called in and spoken with someone and he said that he had been manning the phones all morning. I showed him the number I called and he told me that was for the main Scoff & Banter reservations line.If the system is down, don't you think maybe you should call your main office and have them manually provide you with the list of reservations for the day? The waiters had to scramble to put a table together for us and they ended up combining several tables of different shapes and sizes into an awkward L-shape jammed into a corner near the buffet. This layout made for an uncomfortable business lunch where half the table felt cut out of the overall conversation. When I looked around for a better option, I noticed that the entire restaurant is in a lounge style, with no proper seating for parties of 8 or more. I was surprised that the reservations line wouldn't alert me to the fact that they were basically unable to comfortably host large groups.Once we were seated, the staff took forever to take our orders and the service was exceptionally slow. Appetizers took well over 45 minutes to arrive, and by that time our table was getting restless and growing increasingly hungry, as they did not even serve bread.The food was decent, and they have a respectable wine list, but I wouldn't recommend coming here for anything other than breakfast, and only then if you're a guest at the adjoining Radisson Blu Edwardian Hotel."
Food was not bad place was clean but atmosphere was lacking
William Ale & Cider House is an East London Boozer located a few minutes' walk from Liverpool Street Station. Booked a table for 12 people that was located in the far right of the Pub. It's a nice atmosphere for drinks on a Friday night. I am unsure about all these Ales and Ciders but I had a nasty bitter drink from the Lagunitas range that I struggled to finish. The staff are jolly and helpful. The ladies toilets were particularly small.
"Effort in each dish shines through on each visit. Best breakfast ever, you pay extra for beans that are not included but it's worth it for pickle and ryes own recipe with molasses and pork I have never tasted anything like it."
"There's a great atmosphere in the pub, which I remember as an Old Irish boozer. The Junction has moved with the times, but retains the atmosphere The food was delicious and the service was great - good value too. I definitely will be back."
Granted that the place was very busy but even so there are so many tables packed into this tiny space that I felt very claustrophobic. The first table we were shown to(actually the menus were plonked on the table and the waiter walked away) was so squashed next to other people that neither my friend or I could get to the furthest seat! We moved ourselves to another table. The coffee was ok and reasonable but when it came to pay we eventually had to wait at the till by the door as no one was able to process our order except for the lady who served us. Ridiculous! If there had been any kind of emergency I would dread to think of trying to get out quickly. I won't be back.
"This is a chain, so if you like another branch then you'll like this one. Reliable food and reasonable service. Can get very busy. Friday night seems to be after-office night so expect it to be full, with smart suits and lots of drinking!? Disconcerting mirrors on the walls can make you feel like you're being watched. But light and bright for all that."
We went in for dinner and do not regret it. Very lively atmosphere with great staff and food. Would definitely recommend...
"We went monday night, the service relaxed and friendly, the food was very good. Well worth a visit although might be best to avoid busy nights given what some of the other reviews say."
"Went with my girlfriend for what was an amazing dinner. The staff was super friendly, regardless how busy this place was. Stunning meat selections and delicious bourbon expresso martinis with the oreo doughnuts. good recommendations."
"I thought that I had been handed a business card on the way in and promptly lost it in one of my many pockets. Alad that was my personal charge card. Food is delivered as a counter service with everything prepared to your taste in front of you. There is lots of choice and all ingredients are fresh. Customers are issued with a pager for items that need cooking, such as pizzas, to tell them when they are ready to collect. To settle your bill just take your charge card to the ayment counter on exit. A truely modern experience if not slightly bizzare. The food got the thumbs up from all four of us."
Service was one of the best in London. The team was very attentive. We ordered two butter chickens and rice. Left with left over for lunch the next day as we were soooo full. Lovely and clean inside also.
"In one of the best area of London, a beautiful restaurant with very nice and professional employees and most of all, one of the best Indian cuisine in Town with a one star michelin since 2007!"
"very good welcome, drinks and nibbles came very quickly. Waitress not fazed as it took our group a while to assemble. Orders taken with no fuss-great. Food delivered quickly and presented well. It is not the greatest-but this is a chain so what do you expect. You get value for money and in Mayfair you can ask for no more. 10 of us tested lots of different dishes and all sent back empty plates for starters/mains /puddings.Loads of beer and wine-shame the selection of beer is not betterPrice for 10 including drinks and tip, 3 courses £350.would happily go again for a group cheapo night out-excellent all round"
"I like this restaurant, it feels a little dated, but the food more than makes up for it. Little pricey too but we like this restaurant for date nights."
"The princess of Shoreditch was a great choice for my birthday celebration. The food was superb, the service very nice, overall a very pleasant evening. We will be back!"
"I went here with my wife and daughter last Friday. I had booked a table but somehow the owner (Tom) had me arriveing an hour later. Confusion over, we went into the adjoining pub whilst our table was sorted. One half of this place is a traditional pub and the other half looks like a very long sitting room, with various size tables dotted about. Tom joined us in the pub and we went through his verbal menu. We had the lamb shank, steak and mushroom pie and ham and chips. The food is home cooking at its best and plenty of it. I had the pie and can back up tom's boast of ""no gristle in my pies"". Seriously one of the best pies I have had. If you like good honest food served by a very funny Irish man, look no further. You will have a great time here."
"Lovely ending after shopping and browsing on regent street . The sweets are all unique , try the one with the chestnut."
This restaurant has excellent fish & chips. It is located in a 250 year old building with lots of charm and a very cozy feeling inside.
"The location and the way the restaurant is decorated is of course great. The food however is average - though the steak is really good. Also, make sure to order dessert - the Caramel Fondue is absolutely TO DIE FOR. Apart from that, it didn't stand out for me."
"We eat at Indigo prior to a recent visit to the Opera.The performance commenced at 7pm which made timing critical given that the restaurant did not open until 5.30pm. We need not have worried; the restaurant admitted us early to look at the menu and make an early food selection.The pre- theatre set menu was excellent offering a good selection in all three courses. The service was prompt and the food very good, exceeding our expectations. We even had time for a 'relaxed' coffee before walking up the road to The Royal Opera.This is an excellent location for a quality meal in a relaxed environment close to Covent Garden and its surrounding theatreland. It also provides a great oportunity for 'people watching' in the bar below!"
Always wanted to try this place and so glad that I did. Such a simple concept but the pancakes are lovely and can't wait to try this place again and try a new pancake. Might even forego the restaurant first and just go here instead. Shame it is such a distance away for me as I can't really justify just popping in for a take away
"Excellent service, delicious food, great location and a great wine list. Not too expensive either. Feels a little less pretentious than the main club. Definitely worth a visit."
"This place is a hidden gem in a crowded Shoreditch restaurant scene. Don't wait for Duck and Waffle, skip out on Poppies, and head over to Strut and Cluck for some mind-blowing, Mediterranean-inspired turkey. Part comfort, part out there, 100% delicious. ive lived in the area for about 6 months and tried a lot of the local places - this is one of the best. Great, unique theme, quiet and warm ambiance, and delicious food and drink.Recommend this place for anyone looking for a casual, fairly priced meal for 2 or more. I know we'll be returning."
"We were really looking forward to our Gaucho experience, having had really pleasant evenings at other establishments in the chain. Catching up with an old friend I'd not seen for several years. However, one (or should I say two) events proved to mar our whole evening here...and it was in regards to the wine. We ordered an Argentinian number, 2007 vintage on the menu. However, the waiter brought out a 2010 vintage of the same bottle. He claimed 'oh yes, the menu has a mistake'. Really? So at £35, it can't have been the first time this had happened (if it really was a mistake), so why on earth hadn't they changed the wine menu to reflect what was really in the cellar? To make more margin, no doubt, by trying to fob us off with a later (and much cheaper) vintage and thinking we would be too dumb to notice. But we weren't too dumb. Little did they know, that one of our party had been on a wine course all that week- this sharp practice wasn't going to escape his eagle eyes! We sent it back without even having it opened.. Ordered a different wine (£37 this time). 2 mins later the waiter returned 'Oh, sorry we've run out of that one'.Really? What a remarkable co-incidence. Or was that because you again only had later year's vintage in the cellar than what was on your wine list, and you didn't want us to catch you out twice? This sort of thing should really be illegal: Trade Descriptions Act, and we'll be taking some advice from a family member who is a lawyer on this. So we ordered a THIRD choice wine: this time the year on the label did actually match the year on the bottle (we were all waiting with baited breath wondering what on earth the waiter would bring out/ say to us upon his re-appearance this time. Perhaps this option is only available when you're spending £42 on a bottle or above then? Unbelievable: we hate this kind of rip off/ taking us for fools behaviour. So that marred the whole evening as I say. We didn't leave a tip (think the waiter knew that was coming), and we shall not be going back (we advise anyone else also not to visit, unless you like to bolster an already expensive restaurants profits further by potentially falling foul to deception of the highest order). And the food? That actually wasn't too bad: but if you're going to rip off customers like this, guess less people are going to end up tasting it over time. Shameful behaviour."
"Once you get to know the people they warm up, mostly Portuguese apparently not actually Spanish but it doesn't matter. The food is good, ive only had the tapas style dishes but the main dishes look delicious. A great place to be outside in the summer, it's very local, a good place to go anytime of the day, be it with friends, a date, eating or just drinking. My preference for dishes; kidneys cooked in sherry, calamaris, lamb cutlets are excellent, great rice..."
"Went for dinner on a Friday night and took the precaution of getting a reservation. Good job as they were turning people away. Sparsely and quirkily furnished (complete with open canoe hanging from roof and a Vespa in the corner taking up precious table space) this is a Maida Vale gem of a place. Starters were all about £5, mains about £12. Unheard of value in this neighbourhood and the cook, Daniella presumably, has great skills and a deft touch. The seafood frittura mista starter was just right; salty and fresh and not too much. The frezella bruschetta starter equally authentic. The fillet of beef came with al dente green beans and a drizzle of balsamic, and some pan coloured cherry toms. The chicken escalope superbly crispy yet tender. We shared a pudding which is a good move as the portions for the tiramissu was generous. We will be back!!"
"I'm usually a very positive reviewer and love most all places I go to, however, this restaurant was the worst food I have ever had in any restaurant ever. I am not exaggerating. I had the pollock with the prawns, my husband had the lamb, which were both not at all good. My daughter had the beef which was pretty good. Both beer choices were not good either. I'm sorry to say, but we were very disappointed...especially for the price."
"Been to several Pret a Mangers in London and each time the food is good and reasonably priced. The chain strives to source its food locally and it is always fresh and there is always a good variety of sandwiches. Excellent for a quick, cheap lunch in London!"
"We had vegetarian and meat full English breakfasts, muffin with smoked salmon and hollandaise, and a chick pea/avocado/tomato alfalfa combo. All the food was lovely, served beautifully, came to the table hot and was a real treat. With drinks we paid £50, and thought it was good value for money. It's probably a good thing for my bank balance that we don't live closer!"
"I came here tonight with my Mum & sister! We had a lovely evening, great family atmosphere, friendly & attentive service from staff & excellent food! I will come back again! Great evening :-) highly recommended!"
"A brilliant family run business with tasty, flavoursome food. Mother Chef customises the meal just for you. Worthwhile visit if you're in Harlesden!"
This is our restaurant of choice when we have visitors to London.The menu covers most options and the quality of food is very goodService is always to a high standard and the prices are reasonable
"Though not the fastest, you always get good quality and tasty food at Wahaca. Even though we had a change of waiter, the service was consistent, though not overtly attentive. The restaurant was busy all afternoon for the Para-athletics, but they seemed to cope well. Let your imagination run wild and be adventurous in your choices and you will not be disappointed."
"We dined at Thirty Six as a party of three for lunch on a Thursday when there was a tube strike. The restaurant is in the basement of Dukes Hotel and is very elegant. It was very quiet but there was a pleasant, relaxing atmosphere. The service was friendly and courteous. We chose from a limited choice lunch menu of 3 starters, 3 main courses and 3 desserts including tea or coffee and petit fours for £32. I had Cornish Mackerel, Spring Lamb and Peanut Crunch, all of which were excellent but the portion of mackerel was on the small side. An amuse bouche of mushroom cappuccino was delicious. We wou would have liked to have tried the Tasting Menu which is only available for dinner so we may have to return to try this. Recommended."
Tasting food and warm atmosphere! the service was really fast and Marco was really kind. My favorite dish is Tom kha chicken!
Wonderful service (Luigi) and perfect setting for leisurely drinks and food while being gently rocked by the river - we definitely need to be regulars!
"Like the food very Much, was a very nice experience. Food was amazing, great tastes. I love the concept with the Kitchen to prepare everything live (Open Plan).Service was very good, my only dissappointment was the service from the Sommelier. The White Wine came correctly in the right Temperature but the Red Not. Was warm, totaly wrong Temperature (Was a 3 ltr botttle of Rioja Roda) unacceptable for me for a Restaurant of its Kind. Also noone was willing to come and serve wine again when glasses was empty. Apart of this definetly we will go back in our next visit to London. For People who like Great Food Bar Boulud is a MUST!Also dont Miss the Chance, to Visit the Mandarin Oriental Main Bar for Great Cocktails and Supurb SERVICE!"
"We did not experience the bar, only the dining area. This review is only about the dining experience, and not the 'pub' experience.The starters were good. So much better than the mains that my partner and I decided it was better in hindsight just to try all the starters instead of the mains. The mains were essentially gravy poured over meat. Nothing special. The roasted duckfat potatoes were better than most potatoes, though its hard to get super creative with them.Please try the Cullen Skink when you're here (a scottish soup tasting like a cross between bisque and chowder). It is really fantastic, though for 6 pounds the amount of ingredients could fit in the palm of a baby. Up to you to decide whether if that is worth it. The deep fried pork balls were also done okay. Poor batter, but tender meat.Lastly, this was probably because it was during New Year's Day itself (hence a shortage of staff) but we waited quite long for our food. 20 minutes for the starters, and another 15 for the mains. Hopefully this isn't the wait time on normal staff days because it really got to an unbearable point (that point where you're too full from your starters to even look forward to your main dish, only to be disappointed by it). Kudos for opening on 2015 though. I'd be hungry if not for you."
Attended for a celebration with 5 people . The food was very average and very expensive . When my main meal Arrived it was cold . Atmosphere was good but overall a disappointing evening .
Arrived just after 1300 hrs on a Friday.Was shown to a seat very quickly and our order was taken promptly.Despite being busy our orders came swiftly. The presentation was good and tasted very good. Will use this place again. Plenty of shops in the Market to browse around afterwardsy
I used to love this restaurant however tonight I went there to find the smallest salmon nigiri ive ever eaten in my many years of eating Japanese food. I see that the takeaway menu is cheaper than the eat in restaurant which they charge higher prices plus service charge.
"Very busy, but then you'd expect that in Covent Garden. Service was a bit chaotic, we ordered 4 pizza's. The Margaret was very nice but the Red Ox and British Hot were to die for. I would definitely brave the chaos to eat them again, that's for sure, though its not cheap you do get a seat in a beautiful setting."
"Dinner for two, attention from the staff, poor at best, no coordination, plates Arrived as and when, plus they had no idea how to serve a table.The area was so badly illuminated no way to see the menu, why?the food poor spring rolls, ok dim sung, and good fish, but the evening was spoilt by the standards of the staff, such a shame!"
"Visited this cafe close to Piccadilly Circus. There were more staff than customers, but it still took ages to be served. The order was not taken correctly - we just put up with it. Coffee was £5 and not great. The same went for the cake. Go for a look, but don't eat there."
"Nice and friendly athmosphere, helpful staff.The food was ok, not excellent I probably was expecting more. The Tonkotsu Ramen was ok although I preferred the starters: chicken gyoza and prawn katsu, and even better the dessert..mochi ice cream! the caramel one was delicious. Not a lot of choice in the menu, maybe this could be improved."
With all the tourists this restaurant is busy but there and many better places to eat around Covent Garden. The service was rude and rushed and food mediocre and tasteless. Not worth the high prices they charge at this tourist trap.
"we had dinner here last night and was pleasantly surprised as i have eaten in the one in Geneva last month. the food is excellent the service is on point and the restaurant is set out in the same way, don't miss out give it a try. i do not understand why this place is not full up."
"We returned yet again to Polpo for lunch in the week. As ever the food was delicious and the service friendly and helpful. Highlights for us were the goats cheese and kale pizzette, the arancini and the frito misto. Its a buzzy place and tables are close so don't expect a romantic meal but for lunch of a very high quality and full of interesting menu choices this is the place!"
"Only stayed for one drink as not a nice venue. Five of the draft lagers unavailable. Such a shame gone down hill as when it was The Tottenham, it had really improved over last two years."
"I'd never heard of this place before, but I'm told that it may be one of a small chain. I was helping my son and his partner to move house on Father's Day and my reward (!) for both events was to be 'taken for a curry'.I don't eat straight 'curries' as they are invariably too darn hot and as a result any real flavours are blown away, but it's just a figure of speech between us, so when I was told that it was not really an Indian restaurant but a Nepalese one, I was quite excited as it would be a first for me!The place is in a converted pub and was nicely decorated inside and out, the staff were smart with crossed UK and Nepal flags plus Ghurka crossed knives on their 'tops'. I spite of it being Father's day we were not able to book far ahead as we were not sure at what time we would be free to go. My son rang to make a reservation for 19:00 about an hour before and we got a table, no problem. Once there, drinks were brought quickly along with a 'Starters Only' menu, which we thought was a bit pushy although we were going to have them anyway. Then a waiter brought cleansing wipes so that we could have clean hands before we got our food; a nice touch. When we placed our orders for the first course, we were brought the main course menu ""so that could be cooked whilst we were eating our starter"". Again, a nice touch showing that things seemed to be well organised. We all chose Nepalese food and were very impressed with the presentation and taste of the starters, which were similar to Indian but different at the same time. The mains were likewise, They came in a reasonably prompt timescale after the starter but long enough to give us time to sit back and look around at the surroundings. The place was about half full although diveiders made it hard to see into all the corners. When the mains came I could taste the different flavours in mine however my son typically went for the hotter stuff so his was not so different from the average Indian. (I made sure I finished mine before trying his). All four of our party were very impressed with the premises, the service, the presentation of the food and the attention we received and all would go back.I can't comment on the value because I didn't pay, which made my visit all the better!"
"We have dined in some fantastic restaurants in our travels and we were brought a gift experience for a meal at the Galvin la Chapelle, the building is extremely impressive and sits nicely in the square, on entering we were greeted and our coats taken, we were shown to the bar and offered a drink, after about 15 mins we were shown to our table, the first reaction was the look of distain from those on the next table and a look up and down to see if I was suitable it seemed. We sat at our table and then we met the waiter what an arrogant person, my wife worked in the French embassy and speaks fluent French and could tell he in her mind was putting on the accent, he mumbled the menu that we could chose from, and walked away, hence the table next to us then discussing our presence.The menu was limited to a choice of three starters, mains and deserts, I choose from the wine menu, and the waiter reappeared like a bad smell, he asked my wife if she was having trouble choosing, she said no and he asked for the choice of food, I asked for the wine and he seemed surprised that I knew my wines and what I had selected.The food and waitress who served the wine and main course was extremely good, and very friendly, all through the meal the table next to us continued to look us up and down, I was about to say something and my wife asked me not too.Because we had a gift voucher, it seemed we were treated as second class, I did have the last laugh, when I pointed out that we had eaten at two of the other group restaurants, which this waiter had never visited.The food we had although on limited menu was very good, the staff however were in some case up themselves and should take a reality check. They in some cases do not know who they are serving, my brother and I are taking our wives again to see the reaction when we choose from the normal menu."
"Fabulous food. I had a mixed shish which was perfect . My friend enjoyed the mixed grill. Great value and portions were just right. Waiters were attentive but not overly and we stayed around 3 hours, never feeling rushed. This is somewhere I will definitely revisit."
"I ate here several months ago and was eager to dine here again with a friend. What a terrible disappointment. I had the Empire Chicken, just like last time. Was it really chicken? Either the chickens are very small in the UK or they actually served me very dry Cornish game hen. Jamie, Cornish game gem isn't the same as chicken. Here are a few reasons not to serve Cornish game hen: 1) unless it's perfectly cooked, it tends to get dry (which mine was); 2) it's very difficult to eat with a knife and fork...you took away the option for me to eat with my hands because I'm not going to walk 50 yards to use a public toilet at Covent Gardens to first wash my hands; 3) it doesn't present nicely on the plate after you've pulled off all the meat...it looked like a mass killing on my plate (aftermath photo attached); it's just too much work, so if you're going to serve Cornish game hen, you really need to warn people. Also, I was disappointed you turned down the heat on the yoghurt dressing. All in all, very disappointing. Time for a menu reboot."
"went there twice, nice place for a quick bite however I expect much more cheese from a cheese toastie (probably there were just 2 slices)I also tried the mac&cheese one and it was much better, however it got cold really fastwhat really puts me off it's the ridiculous 50p charge to sit there"
"I'd heard good things of this place, so was interested to try it, the friend I was with had been here a few months ago, and said it was very good. It was a quiet Saturday early evening, with less than half the tables full. We had the hock and potato croquettes, to start, which were definitely more potato than hock, and at over £1.80 each were pricy for what they were. The onion rings contained the merest slither of onion in them. The chicken, although tastier than your average supermarket bird, was dry, particularly on the breast. I did mention this to the waitress, but she wasn't the slightest bit interested. The little jug of gravy to accompany the chicken, was a nice touch, but was way to salty. I had the Hix IPA which at £6.75 was extortionate for what it was. It tasted fine on it's own, but wasn't tasty or strong enough to accompany the chicken, and became bland and insipid after food.  My friend said it had definitely gone downhill from their previous visit, and I have to admit that although there were some nice touches, the food wasn't good enough for the prices being charged. It was basically an upmarket Nandos.One final thing, that I do find annoying is on leaving the restaurant not be even acknowledged by the the staff at the entrance desk, as they were too busy chatting to each other. I'm sure that wouldn't happen at a proper Mark Hix restaurant."
"¢ served by waiter named Pla (not sure of the spelling sorry) (stalky build,dark hair,dark eyes,cropped hair ). He's new (I think,as I overheard his manager comment ""you're doing well"" & I absolutely second that as he gave excellent service. If you're lucky,you'd get him as your server. ¢ food was nice & I won't complain about the price as what do you expect in a mall,in LONDON,UK."
"The pizza was absolutely amazing. ive always heard good things about the food here so I was definitely not disappointed! Although they were very busy so from time to time it took a bit longer for us to be seen, the positive outweigh the negative. Would love to go back again"
"This was my second stay at the Hospital Club, which is a priveate clubs with one floor of guest rooms. I had a Large room this visit and on my previous visit and both times I really liked my room. The rooms all feature artwork by different artists. My room was very comfortable and a nice bathroom with plenty of for your toiletries etc. The room was very quiet, which is impressive as the floors above and below are for the club (which as a hotel guest you can use). There are different bars and restaurants in the club, which serve food and drinks and can get lively at times. There is wifi everywhere, and if you want to leave your room there is always a comfortable place to relax, have meals or drinks, or work on your laptop... There are not a lot of rooms so it is best to plan well in advance. Convenient location in Covent Garden area, with lots of restaurants and markets if you wish to buy your own food and keep it in the small fridge in the room."
Authentic Japanese food beautifully displayed in little ceramic plates and wood bento box. Feel like admiring a piece of art. Great service compliments the experience. Eating while enjoy watching master chefs cooking. Must visit if you love Japanese food.
My wife spotted the venue when wandering around Covent garden and decided it was time for lunch. The food was very nice with the pizza being the highlight for me. The staff were very attentive and the atmosphere was great.
Pret a Manger is a chain that serves ready made sandwiches and other quick bites and soft drinks. The sandwiches were fresh and the prices were reasonable. You can eat in or take away.
A brillian high street staple.. love prets menu and ambience for a quick snack
A friend and I went to Reggie's after trying a few places on the high road and being disappointed by what was on offer. I am sooo glad we found it! It was quite late by the time my friend and I went in to Reggie's and the lady who served us was lovely. Me and my friend both ordered the same thing but unfortunately there was not enough for two full portions so the lady kindly offered to charge me less. The portion I got was more than enough! The food was soo tasty and although we were there quite late we didn't feel as though we were being rushed to eat so we could get out. I would definitely go back if I'm ever in the area.
"I was looking for somewhere cheap, quick and convenient before the theatre, and this was directly opposite. I ordered a pulled pork pizza and an Eton Mess with blueberries, and both were surprisingly good. The thin-based pizza was excellent, and produced promptly as promised. The staff were friendly and helpful. Far better food at far better value than expected. I would return."
"My friend had booked here with a theatre deal and we had paid the company up front for our meal. However, when we Arrived they had our booking but no note that it had already been paid for. We could so easily have been turned away but the Manager not only honoured the deal we had but also gave us a drinks as well. The staff and especially the Manager are a real credit. The food was lovely and no scrimping on portion size. What could have put a dampened on our day turned into a real positive. Thank you Dim Tea, I would nit hesitate to recommend your restaurant"
"I booked a table for my day's birthday and all three of us were looking forward to what seemed like a lovely place to eat. We had booked for 8.30 and Arrived a few minutes early. The waiter practically pushed a couple out of the door (they were just starting to get up from their table) so we could sit down. After ordering starters and main courses we then waited almost 45 minutes for the starters to arrive (pigeon, salmon and asparagus). They were okay, but nothing special after such a long wait. When the main courses Arrived I was even more disappointed. Both my mum and I had ordered steak - hers was okay but mine was truly dreadful. It was meant to be rib-eye, but was the thinnest stringiest piece of meat I think I have ever seen someone try to serve. On top of that I had asked for it to be cooked rare and it was very overdone. When I complained they offered to bring me another. By this point my parents had finished their main courses and I didn't want to be eating so far after them. I asked to speak to the manager who did go some way to compensating me for a ruined evening. Honestly though I won't be going back as I wouldn't want to risk another horrible evening like that one. Why would any chef worth their salt send out two such obviously different quality steaks and think the customer wouldn't notice?!"
"Visited with a group of friends on Saturday night. The service received from our server Dee was outstanding, she really did add to the whole experience. Food was excellent, didn't quite know what to expect but shows you that you don't need to buy expensive cuts of meat for it to be delicious! Highly recommend to all, oh and the Bavette medium/rare is phenomenal! Thanks again for the fantastic evening!"
"Visited this well known fish restaurant with friends for lunch.Well prepared quality fish at reasonable prices for inner London. The battered haddock was excellent, light batter and not greasy. Recommend the vanilla cheesecake for dessert. A little pricey at £6.00 but large portion size, so still worth it.Service very good, although had to request second bottle of wine twice (restaurant not particularly busy at the time)."
"Came here on a groupon deal £34 for 2 courses and a bottle of wine. We had pork belly and the scotch eggs, steak and sticky toffee pudding. Was a really lovely meal, nice atmosphere and great service. Now we know about it (discovered via groupon) will certainly be back in the future and recommend to friends. A very special experience"
The food is relatively expensive small plates so you need a lot to fill you up but it is interesting and delicious. The staff are friendly but absolutely hopeless when serving the drinks. Twice we were given the wrong wine and beer and it is very chaotic. Maybe it's a generation thing but it is definitely not a place to have a quiet leisurely meal.
"Good food, friendly service and not expensive.We had to wait a little longer than we may have liked for the bill to arrive but the fragrant coffee sweetened the wait."
"What an amazing night.. Ruben Kane is an absolute born entertainer, we didn't know what to expect from the night but we weren't disappointed. The staff were so attentive and welcoming. This is a must for anybody looking for something different to do in London."
You know what you get with Marco Pierre White's restaurants and menus. Good decent British food that's well presented with good service. Perfect before a big midweek Champions League game (there won't be one of those for a while alas) and if you are entertaining businesswise. Book ahead though.
"We booked last minute and were able to get a table for 2 on a Saturday at 6.30pm. The restaurant is an exceptional venue, with great music, great music and fantastic attention to details. The service is very friendly, personal and professional, our waiter, Mo, was in particular of very good advice."
"We were met by a pleasant young lady who took our cocktail order and we sat on the rear deck for drinks. Our table in the restaurant was by a window with a view of the London Eye and Big Ben across the ThamesOur food order was taken, i had to ask for drinks and to order wine.My wife had what the menu described as Portugese octopus salad for starter, it did not look like any octopus I have ever seen and I was told had no flavour at all. my Duck Salad was on the other hand delicious. I asked for bread as none was offered. For mains we had steamed salmon, declared ""quite good"" and rib eye steak which was tender and came rare which is exactly as I ordered. Puddings Eton mess which was cream and merangue with a few strawberries on a plate, looked a mess but I dont think from Eton. Cheese board was OK"
"We visited this restaurant for drinks only....just after our lunch . Although I hv emphasised 'drinks only', apparently elderly waiter hvnt heard. Then, when we've ordered the vine (which was excellent ) he came back to asks weather we've decided for food .... I hv repeated that we r for drinks only, and he increased voice follows by very much unpleasant and rude comment -' we r not allowed to serve drinks only'.... So we had to order something against our preference of the moment .... Very unpleasant situation and high level of unprofessionalism ..."
"Great for an early meeting in the City next day- nice rooms and good showers, possibility to have a decent drink and some Food in the pub downstairs in a non-Hotel like atmoshere- a interesting Concept altogether - the only thing that One could change is a box to drop the keys if One leaves early and the pub is not yet open"
"Can't fault the restaurant in any wayFriendly staff, great food with no small kiddies size servings like you get at more expensive placesThe food is truly scrummy :).Will definitely return again soon."
Popped in before theatre. Busy but only waited 5 minutes.Good food but small choice of menu.Pleasant staff and when my wife was not happy with chicken they offered to cook new one straight away.
"Went with family members. Seems that this place is where the Chinese go. Rich menu with many exotic stuff. Tasty, rich in flavor, exactly what you need when craving traditional Chinese. Though I must say that staff are not very friendly. This might be more of a cultural issue difference as not many spoke English. Place seems old and worn out. I will stick to complementing the food since this is what I enjoyed the most. Will not mind visiting again."
"I wrote a review some time ago praising the Drift and have not been there since. However, last night five of us went for dinner and were bitterly disappointed. We were sat at a table so close to the other tables there was literally an inch or two between us, which is somewhat uncomfortable. The chairs were very upright and hard and not at all comfortable to sit and eat in. We were given our drinks, mine was a glass of pinot grigio rose, but when it Arrived it was not rose, so I sent it back. They quickly brought me the correct drink and some tap water, which was lukewarm, so I asked for some ice, but that never Arrived. We shared starters of calamari which was lovely and chicken satay which was very nice too with a nice spicy peanut sauce. When my main Arrived it looked ok. I had the Wagyu burger, but I was very disappointed with it. It was cooked nicely but there was little taste and was supposed to have blue cheese with it but I struggled to fine any. All meals were equally unimpressive. My sister had the fish pie which looked really nice, but she said it was really salmon pie as she didn't find any other fish in it. The others ordered truffle chips with their cheese burgers and halloumi burger, but were really disappointed as they were soggy from too much oil and excessively garlicky. When our bill Arrived we had a suggested tip of £13 which we didn't feel was warranted, so we just put in a few pounds instead. They actually came over to me and complained that they were £8 short of their tip so I explained that it was optional and we were not happy to give them the full tip. Obviously, they were not happy !Cannot recommend this place any moreFoxyfox10"
"Very basic dishes served in surroundings that could do with a substantial upgrade. Nice staff, but well below par food and dishes on offer. Has the feeling of a money making machine rather than a nice restaurant."
"Promised to be seated in 20 min, it took almost 1 hour and 20 min stuck in the bar we had the complain. Still when we ordered food it was 25 min after the table next to us even thought we ordered first. This place is a disorganised joke."
This is the third Cote restaurant that we have visited. We preferred the layout of the St. Christopher's Place restaurant and service was better both there and in Charlotte Street than it was here (even allowing for the fact that it was busy). We had been to a Cote three times previously and eaten from the a la carte menu. But this time we tried the pre-theatre menu. The choices are limited but we both chose the chicken parfait followed by steak frites and both provided sizeable portions and delicious food for only £11.70.
"ive been here twice and each time I feel the place lets itself down because of the poor service. As it's the second time, I felt a gentle nudge to management via a review would help but see there's been comments already with little change.The staff look great but clearly weren't hired for any skills in service. After sliding in awkwardly through the front door where if the maitre d is standing at the booking table, you'll no doubt walk right into them, I was shown to my table and offered drinks. The house white Arrived lukewarm, we had two waitors taking our orders and so there was a mix-up there. Unfortunately the unfriendlier of the two came back and was pretty aggressive when correcting our orders because she was confused (as were we).We ordered more wine, also Arrived (via a third waiter, perhaps an actual somelier? why three waiters?) lukewarm but at least were offered an ice bucket upon mention. Oysters were great at happy hour for £1 each but would definitly pass on a full meal because of the service."
good value for your hard earned pennies! Good selection of rolls and sandwiches to choose from. catering for most peoples tastes.
"Stopped off at the princess for a couple of beers and some food after work. The princess really delivered this time with a very full cheeseburger served how I asked for, quickly and without fuss. Service was friendly and prompt. Just what we were looking for."
"Good choice of Thai, very well prepared spicy food and great coconut soup. Very good ratio value/price.We took Wagamama during lunch because as there was very little occupation (read as almost nobody as it was Monday) and we like fresh asian pasta. Food was very good, really fresh, clean a and well tasting.Service was very confusing. We have been served by 3 people while there was almost empty restaurant -> everything took ages and waiting 20 min for bill was the best finale you could imagine during lunch :). Clearly fail. It is scary to imagine how the guys organize themselfs during high hours."
"We had a very nice spontaneous Dinner with our 2kids there. The waitress was extremely nice with the kids, service was friendly and fast, the atmosphere cosy and the food was very good. I would definitely go back."
"Party of two went for early dinner. Restaurant was energetic, the food was tasty, and the service attentive. Definitely a place to go. Try the specials - they are always worth the stop. I will go again this week."
"aware of this restaurant from the TA reviews. easy to find this restaurant.. me and my friends ordered the famous fish and chips.quite big portion. the fish r so fresh and it wasnt greasy.you must try it.i loved the ambience of the restaurant..relax and calm tho it's small.oh ya, we are so lucky because not so many ppl when we reach there..the service was good,fast and the staffs also very friendly.definitely will come again for the fish and chips."
"We dined in this restaurant (5 minutes away from Kensington High Street tube station) with four friends - all of who are discerning ""foodies"". We had not been to the hotel or restaurant previously and weren't sure what to expect. Suffice it to say that it far exceeded any hope that we might have had beforehand.We had drinks in the very pleasant decor of the bar area beforehand and were attended by a very knowledgeable and personable cocktail barman; some of the selections, even amongst the beers, were sufficiently ""different"" to make for interesting trial tastings - all to our complete satisfaction.When we adjourned to the restaurant we were taken to a very pleasant table with plenty of room around us and well away from other tables (I hate being crammed in in restaurants and hence being forced to listen to the conversations of people that I don't know!). There was an excellent selection from the menu, without it going on endlessly, which suited all tastes. When the food Arrived it was beautifully presented and was very nutritious. We always say that the test of a good restaurant is that when you have completed your meal you shouldn't feel bloated and neither should you be looking for the nearest ""chippy"" because you are still hungry; the Park Terrace fulfilled this criteria 100%. We were not rushed between courses and staff were attentive without being there every five seconds.There was an excellent choice of wines - albeit a bit pricey (eg £37 for a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc) but this hotel/restaurant does special deals through Travelzoo vouchers whereby the price of the three course meal plus cheese board, coffee and a cocktail each worked out to a total of £59 for two (the cocktails alone would have cost £20), so paying a bit more for the wine was more than absorbed in what turned out to be a very reasonable cost.Would we come again? Definitely - it is very strongly recommended especially if you make use of the voucher system."
"On a trip to London with my husband we visited Union Jacks on Saturday the 23rd April. We had the worst meal of the weekend. Soup was dish water with frozen veg, chicken was under cooked and the Steak was full of fat. Management needing to look at their rubbish food. Very poor and over priced."
"We have been to this restaurant before but took friends there before a trip to the Barbican. We loved it and so did they. The food is excellent and lots of choice. Service was really good. All in all, we had a great time."
"Good food, good service and good atmosphere .what else.Will come back.Finally not the usual restaurant around the world."
"The dim sum was excellent. I have had a lot of dim sum and this was outstanding. NOT the emperors new clothes. The prawn toast was exceptional, sweet and crispy. The cheung fun was delicious - char siew was sweet and succulent. The service was actually very good and polite. Finally not that expensive overall and a lovely treat!"
"The Pre Theatre Menu is very good value for money! The food are beautifully served with attentive service, very enjoyable!"
"Good Italian food, nice idea with the smaller plates. Delicious food and good Negroni! Small restaurant with good slightly slow service."
"If you want to experience staff who do not care about customers, lack courtesy and only want to deliver poor service and feel content to leave people in their eighties without food for two hours, then visit this restaurant! Extremely poor service and the whole time we were there we were treated like second class citizens!!"
"Had dinner here with friends after a conference nearby. Really warm welcome from staff and the food was good. However, despite a big curtain at the door a gale blew through every time it opened, so sitting near the front of the restaurant was a chilly experience and whilst staff were friendly, service was very slow."
"I love Parlour, the food is always excellent, served promptly and the staff are always friendly and helpful. It is a regular venue for med my team being. We were a large table having a team Christmas lunch yesterday and this did not affect the quality of service or the food.Thanks for a lovely lunch as always everyone at Parlour."
Great lunch yesterday - the skate was delicious.Don't be put off by the takeaway fish and chip shop on the corner - the restaurant is lovely and the staff delightful.
"I like to spend few weekends in London, I love this city. Few months ago, a friend of mine took me to Baileys Fish and Chips.It's small restaurant, 4 or 5 tables, the atmosphere and the staff are really nice, the food is excellent, portions are big and it's not expensive at all. So, French people in visit in London, if you want to have a nice and typically English meal: Go to Baileys Fish and Chips !"
we stopped here for a drink as the night was getting started....a priveate club with a great rep. was good fun just hanging out....and i suppose if i was a person who got star struck i would have been in heaven.... they are currently doing some remodeling.....this is not the club for everyone....but worth it to go for a couple of hours.
"Food very reasonably priced , plenty of it and always very taste. Would highly recommend the lamb dishes. If you are going to eat during the weekend make sure you book.because it is so popular sometimes you have to wait for a while whilst your food I'd cooked."
"Our neighbours have been going to Green Pea for years and suggested we try it, We finally managed to get some time in, and we weren't disappointed.The portions are generous but there is no rush, you can take your time, saving space for the delicious homemade dessert.Great evening, made even better by the charismatic owner, Tom! We will def be returning."
I love this place for take away fish &chips. If you are in the area of Marylabone you need to try it!!!
Stopped here for an ice cream and sit down whilst wandering around Hyde Park. Its in a great position and we spent a pleasant 20 minutes watching the lake and bird life. Good ice cream also!
"Scott's is my regular retreat of delight! The essential ingredients of a superb sandwich bar form an enduring trinity, from the superb food, cakes and coffee, affordable prices being in the heart of London, to the fresh, comfortable and welcoming surroundings from the moment you enter the door! Their sandwiches are exquisite, with more than enough delicious filling in them,no matter which one you choose. Clean, efficient and friendly, everything I would expect on a lunch break or after a hard days work! Never been disappointed! Keep up providing London with top quality food!! Would recommend 100%"
"My friend and I ate here for the second time.My friend ordered the thai chicken curry and I had the chicken pad thai. The food was nice, no complaints there.The only thing was that I really can't stand the layout of the restaurant. You're forced to it with strangers if it's busy or expected to be busy at a big table, which isn't very intimate. We asked to be moved before making our order when a smaller table became vacant and the manager said no as the table, which was far smaller than ours, seats 6 people, it looked more like it seated 4 to us. There are no tables inside that accommodate a smaller party, as outside where there were a couple of smaller tables was full.It was only because she over heard our conversation about her attitude from us entering the establishment, telling us they had no outside seating, even though we hadn't asked anything about being seated out there, that she then cleaned the smaller table and seated us there. A family of 6, 3 of which were elderly people were seated on the table of the same size behind us and you could see they were squashed. I wasn't sure how they'd find the arm space to actually eat their food! I became a little irritated by the constant need to ask if they could take our plates that still had food on it! I eventually told the 2 waiters that we'd ask for our bill when we were finished..they took the hint.Made you feel like you had to rush to get out, and there was ample space for newly Arrived customers.Food good, service not so good."
"Arrived at the restaurant without a booking at around 5 30pm (we""d been to a matinee performance in a west end theatre) although the restaurant was comfortable full the receptionist searched the bookings and found us a table the pre/post theatre menu 2 courses £12 95 courses £13 95 was very good value the food and service was excellent I have no hesitation in recommending the Cote Brasserie restaurant"
"We booked this restaurant on recommendation. It was marathon weekend and we knew it would be busy. Only 3 waiters serving a busy restaurant so this did not bode well. We ordered a bottle of Proseco. During opening much was spilt. We were told we'd get a reduction. Twenty minutes later our order had not been taken. We ordered and asked for water. We got the water but no glasses. We asked 3 times for water glasses. The waiter was irritated. We ordered wine. 30 minutes after ordering it we were told they had run out of that wine. No offer of an alternative but just given the wine menu again. Starters finished and plates stacked up. Still waiting for water glasses and to order wine. Waited and waited. Ordered wine. It came. Was opened and left on the table with glasses. No taste and not poured. Mains came. Not as we ordered. They'd run out of side dishes by this stage so just substituted sides without asking! Eventually Offered green beans instead of sweet potato fries. Why did they not know they'd run out of tsweet potato fries an hour before when we ordered? No condiments offered although racks were on other tables. Unable to attract waiters attention as they were so busy. Finished mains and just sat there with empty plates..... And sat there. Not offered dessert so we got up to leave and pay. Having told staff about the Prosecco, wine, sides etc they did knock money off the bill. Food was great but service a total farce."
"We were a group of 23 people celebrating a friend's birthday and couldn't have chosen a better venue. Pre and post lunch drinks on the top deck looking out over the Thames to the London Eye and the South Bank was a hard view to beat and our three course lunch was cooked to perfection. The staff, both for the pre-day arrangements and on the day, were very helpful and friendly and catered for all our needs.We all agreed it was a perfect day I can highly recommend The RS Hispaniola"
"Fantastic atmosphere, sharing platter amazing & port & cheese absolute where perfection. Great for pre & post show drinks"
"Having the urge for an American style breakfast we stumbled upon Little Frankies near Trafalgar. Perfect American Italian feel to the place - and breakfast was only a fiver! The food itself was very good, and the service was friendly. A bit slow on the coffee top up, but due to the rain it soon got very busy in there. Will definitely be back for more"
Beautiful surprise inside John Lewis. Excellent food with prompt service. The views were very impressive as well.
"I was very excited to go to this bar, and was supremely thrilled as i sat down in the train booth.Looking at the menu, prices for cocktails was just excessive. The menus printed as newspaper, whilst fun, were out of date. I asked for the wine and was told the prices were more than advertised. Correct me if I'm wrong, but i don't think this is actually allowed?!We were given 30 minutes, as people had booked seats. (we couldn't help but think this was a created urgency to keep a queue at the door)Sorting the bill we all paid our dues, some paying over to cover some of the ""discretionary service charge."" The waitress returned and said we hadn't paid enough. As Brits we just paid up the extra £3 or so, but afterwards upon checking what we all paid against the receipt, soon realised she had actually returned to collect the ""discretionary"" extra money. When we had already paid over the odds prices, this was sadly very disappointing."
"These guys give the humble toasted sandwich an epic makeover! With options like Nutella or macaroni and cheese, it'll be hard not to please everyone. I had the tricolour (tomato, avocado and mozzarella) on a slightly cold windy day and it was positively soul warming :)"
Me and my friends always come here when we need a top mixxed grill. The food is always really good. I trek from over an hour away for their food because of how good it is.
"We thought Cote Brasserie was very good - food was great, service too, and for 5 of us we thought it was good value - we all enjoyed the evening."
"Possibly the best cocktail bar in the City!You must ask for GABRIEL!!!! Following a light-hearted get-to-know-you, Gabriel will set off and dream up a bespoke cocktail for you. The guy loves a challenge and is true artisan. I'll be back very soon."
"As our little neighbourhood gem we are in love with the Goya. The fit-out is so original and cosy, the menu is long and mouth watering and the service still with the class of the old days! At least once a month we come here for our Friday Dinner at the end of an exhaustive week to start into the weekend. You can only love this place."
"After a day of shopping on Oxford st, my bf and I visited here for dinner on Saturday early evening. Friendly welcome and fast service, good Italian food - bf said it was the best Fiorentina pizza he's ever had! Reasonable prizes..we used tesco reward vouchers so even better value. Would recommend to others."
Having made a reservation for a birthday treat and really looking forward to it we were cancelled 4 days before as there now seems to be a group booking.This booking was made online and would appear their system is not suitably manned. Although apologies were made this really is not good enough as this was part of a whole day experience booked well in advance.
"After a visit to the National Portrait Gallery I had booked us into Cote for lunch.It was well attended so it was as well I booked, we were met by the what I presume was the head waitress very polite and our b ooking was in the book. We were seated at a table for four near the middle of the resturaunt not a bad situation. The ambience is not much to write home about and it was extremely warm.Our waitress Arrived and took our drinks order, very smart and cheery person which must be difficult to keep up when you are rushed off your feet. The white wine was very good crisp and chilled just right.Our order was taken for the starters and the mains one slip what my lady had ordered was not available that day, should have said so on the menu really. The starters appeared very quickly and were very well cooked and fresh to the taste our friends also said they were happy with their choice.The wait for the mains was rather long, however it did not detract from our enjoyment of the meal which was presented on the right sized plates. The wait allowed us to catch with what our friends had been up to in the six months since we had seen them so probably good for a business lunch.The wait however was worth while to main courses were really up to Cote standard with excellent flavour and just the right, amount all at the table were very pleased with the meal overall. The bottle of red that we had was of good quality and went down very wellwith the main courses.One bugbear a group of people were obviously celebrating something and were quite noisy so it was hard at times to hear what was said but better that screaming, gurning kids."
"I expected so much more for the price paid for a meal for 2. The starters were below average, the red curry was tasteless and the chicken was disgusting. The Massaman curry's beef was too chewy and both the coconut rice and sticky rice were tasteless. I would have been better off with a microwave curry (which I hate). Completely disappointed."
"We dined here for my son's birthday. From the minute we Arrived he was made to feel very special. Our drinks order was taken straight away, followed by our food order. The food was hot and tasty and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. The icing on the cake 'so to speak' was when the TGI's team got the attention of the whole restaurant and sang a little birthday ditty to my son whilst presenting him with his desert which had sparklers on, a lovely little touch which left him blushing slightly. The waitress who looked after us was lovely but sadly we're not 100% certain on her name, we think it was Rachel. Well done TGI's for helping us to make some fab memories!"
"I came here on the 13th July 2012 for a friend's 21st birthday and notice it's on the Friday as well. Not sure if the food was unlucky on that day! We Arrived at 8:00pm for our table, which was booked for around 10 people, greeted nicely by the waiters.ServiceThe waiters were generally friendly and polite, they weren't rude or stuck up. Although it's a shame I have to give them 3* for the service as mostly the majority of it was a longgg wait esp. the cocktails, which were sitting on the counter for some time. One waiter asked me and some others if they wanted to pay for their cocktails now and we said yes, but he never did. Some orders were really confusing, we didn't pick the food ourselves, guessing our friend who booked it made the orders already or the person on the phone helped, yet there were some extras that came out so it was quite a waste and more money on the table! I would've ate it, but some of the foods didn't look appetising.I'm not sure what I saw in pictures as the uniforms looked different on photos, but I think it would've felt more like a dining experience if the waiters wore a more proper uniform when serving customers as they look more casual then serving with people's food.FoodThe food was average, it wasn't luxury or that special. I had a Potato & Leek Soup for starter and Seafood Tagliatelle for the main and the portions were really small. My friend had king prawns in hers and some others who had them didn't, so I was quite confuzzled as if the chef just put leftovers in the food. The food would've been better seasoned, such as the hamock which is suppose to be salty, but the sides that came with it didn't contemplain the dish. Although the pasta dish was nice, there wasn't much flavours or seafood in the dish and I was quite shock for the price for it as well. The waiters brought us one bread each from a basket with a big gunk of butter on the plate while most fine dining restaurants they would've prepared them on the table before we Arrived, in a basket as well.ValueWhen writing this review I was curious about the menu prices, since we already got chosen our food before we Arrived and I couldn't believe the Seafood Tagliatelle was £13.50! That small dish was not enough to fill me up it was half the size of the plate. I understand it's a fine dining experience, but not the value or quality of the food was worth the money have to be honest. Although the cocktail drinks were good value anyway! I would've tried the desserts, but we didn't have the time to stay as we were already late to meet our limo driver parked outside.AtmosphereI really love the atmosphere of the place esp. in the night time where you can get a perfect view of the millennium eye. The most atmosphere I got from it all was the pianist who made a good impression to everyone and was also a good laugh! The whole interior was nice and not too shabby, which felt great to be in. The location was good and not too far from the station!The overall feel to the place is warm and welcoming, but shame about the service and food it would've made a better experience. I only hear my friends complaining the rest of the evening with the food and waiting as well our mains didn't come on time when the limo was already waiting for us so there was a bit of a panic with the birthday girl. I'm not sure I would come back although the waiters were good to us all this time, but I definitely sure I won't come back for the food. ive experienced more better fine dining restaurants in Covent Garden with their theatre menus and even The Montcalm! There are lot's to choose in London so even though it's on a boat, there is no need to pay extra for the scenery (unless it's something occasionally special), it's all about the experience with food that is memorable to you."
"Fabulous Japanese restaurant, excellent service, wonderful sushi and sashimi, good choices of premium sakes. This is not a glossy, overdone place that has had the designers in. This is the kind of restaurant that appeared to attract a Japanese clientele, plus some indiveiduals who sat at the sushi bar. The quality of the fish was excellent. Service was swift and attentive, but there was no hovering. We were at the restaurant for 3 hours. We live in a country/city lacking this level of Japanese cuisine, and this satisfied our cravings for a bit. We would go to London to eat there again."
"All I can say here is that the customer service is very good. Other then that the food is not good at all. We had the tapas to share for three people. The description was Falafels, olives, halloumi, feta, tzatziki, hummus and roasted red peppers in spiced tomato sauce with garlic & coriander naan. The presentation was terrible. It looked like some one had thrown up on the plate when it Arrived. Hummus was horrible and bitter, halloumi was in chunks no flavour and feta was like rubber. The bread was too hard really this was very poor. For main I had king prawn chicken mango. The presentation wasn't as bad as our started. But again very average. Child care room for changing was filthy. The floor area was wet and the toilet smelt from urine as soon as you walked in. Clearly in was used by people with no babies. This should be supervised and cleaned at all times especially for babies. Terrible hygiene. Staff were friendly and keen to help. But sadly the food was terrible. We won't be back."
"We didn't realise this is part of the hotel but after our initial surprise, if anything, this made our excellent experience even better.Charming, attentive, professional service, a good menu, beautifully presented and seriously delicious food! Everything was perfect, right through to the birthday surprise and the great value for money. I don't know who the chef is but they must be about the best in London.Non pretentious but happy atmosphere - we will be back!"
We were made to feel very welcome and our table for six was ready on arriveal. There are two floors and both have a good ambience with mood lighting and fresh flower displays at the entrance. Service was prompt and polite. We are familiar with the food at various Gauchos in London and the menu is the same throughout. The filet and ribeye steaks were excellent although my daughter's rump steak was disappointingly dry and tough. The sides were delicious as were the empanadas to start. The wine list is good and the Malbec we chose was delicious. All in all a good experience.
"Arrived quite late on our way back from London but the owners couldn't have been more welcoming. Cracked open a bottle wine followed by a wonderful Special of the Day. Delicious, home-made Palestinian food, just like I remembered when I lived there over 30 years ago! Will definitely return soon and probably make this my local whenever I want local, high quality Mediterranean food. Highly recommend!!!"
"Wow! My husband and I married in Paris last year. We were in London for our one year and wanted a nice, French meal for our anniversary dinner. After looking for weeks and making reservations at other places and canceling because something didnt seem right, we found Chez Patrick. The reviews sold us on the place. Upon arriveal, we were met at the door by a handsome Frenchman who led us to our table and sat us down. This was the kickoff for an enjoyable evening. For the next two hours, we were privey to excellent food, excellent service and great conversation with the table next to us. We enjoyed it so much that we set reservations for a larger party three nights later. Our second evening started with a full table set and waiting for our arriveal. Once again, we were met at the door by the handsome Frenchman. And, once again, the next two hours were full of delicious food, wine and conversation. We all left happy, content with promises of returning. It was an excellent evening and the staff even made it more so. Though the restaurant is on the small side (which I loved too, but not everyone in our party did), we were provided ample room for seating. I visit London often for work and plan to visit the next time I am there! Delicious and satisfying."
"Went there for afternoon tea with friends. Had a very pleasant afternoon catching up but disappointed by the food and service.Passable quality of ingredients. Not great, especially the meats. Cold, chewy steak is no one's friend.Every item of afternoon tea arriveing at the same time (e.g. mulled wine, tea, cakes and hot sandwiches) not a great idea.Impersonal service with little knowledge of what they were selling. I don't expect expertise, but have a script memorized to describe the teas at least.Being overcharged by £150 didn't help matters.It's fine but there's a lot better available at same price."
"Very Good super food salat with salmon or feta, long healthy menue for children, good service, lamb stacke can be better."
"Went during a day trip to London for a late lunch with my husband and 6 year old son. We used our Tesco Vouchers to pay for the food. Had a great meal, hot and tasty, not rushed and good service received. Would go again and although my usual choice has gone for the menu, I tried a new dish and loved it.....so maybe it's not a bad thing...as had got a bit stuck in a rut."
"Good atmosphere, great food.Great lamb chops. We tend to visit every few months and we are never disappointed."
Used to visit many years ago before this restaurant burnt down. So glad to discover it was reopened a while ago. The Dover Sole I had for lunch was moist and full of flavour. My 5 luncheon guests all enjoyed their meals.The service was efficient and the athmosphere pleasant.It is not cheap but good value for money.Always book.
The sea of poppies was breath taking. The visit to the tower made a perfect end to our visit. After dinner we returned to see the night laminations.
I use Donde roughly once a month for casual dining with friends. The tapas selection is very good indeed - some unusual and delicious options. The wine selection is reasonable and everything is well priced - good value. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and the service consistently good. The only thing which marks it down a little is that the restaurant is quite cold - I usually make sure I'm dressed warmly!
"In my opinions, over priced and sadly very bland - we have both eaten in and had delivery, each time both very depressing food wise. Could be far better if it focused more on the food, and less on pushing the brand down locals necks."
"We went with friends for dinner. Unfortunately the waiter spilt candle wax on my bag and shoes and another guest's jacket. Mistakes happen! They were brilliant. Jacket was dry cleaned and returned before we finished our meal, bag cleaned and shoes sent off ( the next day!) and came back spotless......food was great and will definitely return. Thank you for a lovely evening, even if we did get more than we bargained for in the candle wax department!,"
"Even though we hadn't book a table and it was Sunday, Tom managed to get us one. The roast beef was amazing, the potatoes were diveine, the portions were very generous and side orders like vegetables and gravy were free of charge. Amazing place, great value for money, very friendly staff. Thank you Tom for this experience!"
We were delighted to have such a lovely meal ... and loved the little dishes to try so many gorgeous plates. Mac & cheese croquettes with chilli jam were amazing. The homemade gnocchi with chanterelles and walnut were the number one from us though. Three other plates we consumed and all were fab. Managed to get a gorgeous dessert in too. I had pannacotta with coffee biscuits and dark chocolate and was perfect. Staff was efficient and attentive despite it being really busy. Next time I'm in London would def cone back and worth five stars. Also great Italian wine
"We enjoyed a lovely meal here having picked it quite arbitrarily. The food is well cooked and the menu varies and different from the usual Italian chain restaurant.The service and attention to detail were also very good. Sitting on the edge of the wharf means that ""watching the world go by"" as you eat is also very pleasant. If you like Italian give them a try"
"..apart from that there isn't really much more to say other than their garlic bread is pretty special too.Oh and the service is impeccable, annnnd there was a queue outside waiting for tables (in the rain) of about 25 people. So BOOK IN ADVANCE!"
"It's been a great addition to Notting Hill, Egg Break. The menu changes frequently. Today I had the Egg Break Pot which was chia seeds soaked in almond milk, with chopped dates, almonds and some pomegranate seeds on the top. Lovely. And very filling. With a cup of ""posh tea"" as its quoted on the bill, this is a perfect brunch. The staff are friendly, young, males and females, and the upstairs is now complemented by a larger downstairs. Nice decor, very comfortable. Part of Soho House group so you know to have high expectations...."
avocado wrap is good lunch option with probiotic yoghurt drink. don't think I like anything else there
"I came here for a work dinner and I was impressed. The atmosphere was excellent and the service quick. The menu wasn't exactly extensive but there were some interesting choices, which I loved. I started with Ham and hock croquettes which were delicious and filling. I then had lamb, which again was tasty and accompanied by delicious piccalilli.Overall, it was a great experience and highly recommended."
"we decides to have informal dinner in Covent Garden and chose this place as I have never eaten at establishments associated with Mr. Oliver and never will after this ""experience"".Rose wine was out of stock.The main course was delivered before appetisers appeared.The price is way over what the food and service would command. Never again!"
Ate here in July 2013 - directly across from London Eye so perfect location. Sat on sun deck for a drink and then inside for lunch. Food was of excellent quality and prices were quite reasonable. Service was excellent. Would definitely recommend and would go here again.
"My Wife and I dined here after a game at Stamford Bridge. The decor is the first thing that strikes you as soon as you walk in. It is elegant, upmarket and stunningly beautiful. We were shown to our table which was a leather booth to one side of the restaurant. The service all night was impeccable. The waiters were always on hand to top up the drinks, offer more bread, and check everything was ok. I ordered the Cornish crab and the steak. My Wife has the Scallops and the steak. Everything was cooked to perfection and melt in the mouth. The only downside was there was little atmosphere due to there only being five tables in. I was slightly surprised by this until the bill Arrived. The bill was more expensive that the hotel room in the Chelsea hotel attached to the restaurant. It was worth the money but not the sort of place most people can afford to eat in every week."
Was supposed to be a celebratory lunch and totally ruined the moment. Mozzarella bites were unrecognisable burnt cubes. Potato dauphinois was tiny and burnt on the bottom. The burger and chips was minuscule and made my boyfriend look like a giant and the salad was warm and limp. No redeeming features.
Dined here whilst staying at the neighbouring Millennium Hotel on business. The online booking said no tables till 10pm but actually it was half empty on a Wednesday evening. Charming service and appealing meat-based menu but let down by the detail. So the trout salad was nice enough but the whole thing had clearly been pre-prepared and refrigerated (icy cold plate) and lacked some taste as a result. The ribeye was well seasoned but was overcooked - well done instead of medium rare. For a steak restaurant that isn't great! The accompanying bearnaise was very good. Raspberry meringue was fine. Some decent red wines by the glass was good to see and the martinis looked well prepared. So a pleasant meal but not quite liveing up to the price nor hype. (actually a bit like Chelsea FC this season!)
We loved the food and service we had at this restaurant. I had something called Turkish Menemen and it was amazing! My husband had fish and chips and it was delicious. We also had a delicious flat white coffee. I highly recommend this place!
The location is gripping! smack in the midst of the World's most expensive real estate.The site is delightful: the basement of Mandarin Hotel done over ever so tastefully!The small entrance is intriguing when you enter a restaurant bar which covers a large space.The menue is variant and tantalizing! The food is pleasing. The service is great.Make sure you make reservations!Quite an experience!
"Ibleo is a great little place with the best mussels around. The atmospere in the bar is great. Music great, beer great , always get a warm welcome."
"We were looking for a restaurant whilst staying with family and this one came up on ""voucher cloud"". Checked TA and the reports were good so tried it out. We Arrived about 18:30 so the place was empty but that was no problem. Waitress was very friendly. When the food Arrived we were all amazed how good it was, two of our party lived in Majorca for a few years and were very impressed. Must agree with a previous reviewer that the ""pigs cheeks"" are a delight. Yes it is not cheap but would recommend a visit anyway."
"Got in with a Voucher £40 worth of food and drinks and we received 2 cocktails and only one portion of a starter. Even though was not even close to be worth £40 I asked for the food menu to spend good time with my girlfriend. The waiter said that that day they had a standing chef (???) who was not meant to cook anything else but the starter (a selection of ham, salami and cheeses). Therefore the kitchen was closed at 8.15 pm and they could only offer NUTS for dinner."
"After walking around Honor Oak Park looking for a smart daytime spot to catch up on some work, I stumbled across Donde. With a smart interior and friendly staff, I picked up 'The Works' (a cooked breakfast) and latte -- not expecting anything special. To my pleasant surprise, the breakfast was delicious. In particular, the butcher sausages and bacon. To top if off, the blend of coffee was fantastic. Definitely one of the best in the area and a great atmosphere to pickup your midday emails or visit with friends."
"Good coffee, but average. It just can't beat it's famous and very popular competitor..don't think I need to name that chain do I?"
"Excellent pizza really lived up to expectations in terms of real napolitan pizza, but service really below par. Started well with lovely server, very efficient, but we saw him go home. From then on, very poor. Cleared our plates when I was still eating, then completely ignored!! Very disappointing. Had listened this morning to desert island discs when john timpson talked about putting customers first, perhaps I was carried away with that notion, but if this restaurant could learn that lesson, it would be exceptional."
"Every night is Friday! They do amazing cocktails, food and puddings. The service is great, though a little rushed at times. It's loud and boisterous and full of fun so if your looking for a romantic dinner I would go somewhere else. We did have to wait 40mins for a table but it was Friday night- genuinely, so next time would book in advance. Fair value for money though if I'm honest the drinks are expensive. A nice treat!"
"I have been going to this pub regularly since it opened. I have never had a bad pint in all that time. There was a period where, a few years ago, they had very regular staff. Many have moved on. The food is good what you pay for JDW fayre. It is spacious and airy. No complaints whatsoever!"
"We went in search of Italian food in Oxford Street early on New Year's eve. Having not made a booking it was no surprise to be turned away by the always excellent North Audley Street Spaghetti House. But all was not lost! There was room for the four of us at Prezzo, just a few yards away Ò a pizza dough's throw from Oxford Street. The atmosphere is more 'high street chain' than 'Mama's family restaurant' so we were taken aback by the excellent, friendly, rapid service from our italian waitress and by the good, well-prepared fresh food. A perfectly quaffable bottle of Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Arrived at our table with a reasonable price tag of £16. My pizza Vesuvio was aptly named. Hot, sweet red chillis adorned a generous sized, thickish pizza base peppered with pepperoni and mozzarella. This was an Italian rather than British pizza Ò excellent. Karen's lasagne was delicious. Pete had a fine, rare minute steak and Katie had one of the chicken breast dishes which she said was terrific. Had I not been watching my waistline I'd have gone for the panettone bread and butter pudding... but as Katie's concerns are not so great, she had the bombolini (doughnuts)... And actually that was a shame, as they were a little undercooked and sticky inside. But the overall experience was very good indeed and, at £20 a head, not unreasonable."
"Pretty much the only thing this place has going for it is it's staff, they were all fantastic. I didn't like the food at all, and would not describe it as good value for money. We paid £62 for 2 mains, some arancine and 2 drinks. That's mad! Would not go back again at all. There are way better Italian places in London if that's what you're after."
"I absolutely loved this place. I went here with my parents for lunch on Wednesday and really enjoyed it. The meals are prepared with love and the owner is a genuinely hospitable and enthusiastic Italian lady, who clearly loves what she does. I can certainly recommend it to everyone!"
Probably my favourite view in London and great food to match the bar is also worth a visit on a sunny day very good sashimi and friendly staff
"We stopped at this tourist trap for tea and a cake. Although the staff were pleasant the service in the post lunch lull was very slow. The scones and jam were good, just a shame they were served on chipped plates."
Had some food there recently and it was really good. A lot more effort has gone into the menu with some great veggy options. The service is now very good. We'll be back!
"I come here often with friends for a drink, i love the fact that its big inside and you're not cramped trying to socialise. But the thing that lets this place down is the bar staff. One woman (in training) had a face like a slapped bottom and you could tell she was so not happy in her job. She was rude and snappy and slow! But I won't rise to it, I keep a smile on my face (unless they're upsetting me). ive been in their shoes, ive been a barmaid, its not easy! The other factor is, that they all appear not to grace: is the ability to see who's' next in line! I queued up next to a guy who'd been waiting 20 minutes to be served and then I was after him, and the barmen, just walked down the other end of the bar, asking who's next! It can cause arguments! This is my only issue with the place. Food is ok, it is what it is, you don't go in expecting Marco Pierre White standards. I would grace the place like I said, nice building as well."
"The onion tart's pastry was very tough. The steak was tiny and came with only 5 chips! Not only this, the chips we're undercooked in the middle. How can a pub fail to make chips? My friends mullet dish was also minuscule. All dishes were overpriced and underwhelming. Plenty of better options in London."
Simply the best. service excellent with friendly staff and nice traditional atmosphere. excellent location for tubes to anywhere inlondon. food on a par with anywhere in the immediate area that we found.
"What a fantastic evening, narrated by our host (and head chef) Jesse Dunford Wood. He took us on a gastronomic journey that tantalised taste buds, engaged all our senses and had us laughing the entire evening. A combination of 7+ courses, shared, pairing wines and a spectacular dessert show complete with headsets and a touch of Willy Wonker thrown in, a brilliant evening that won't be forgotten. Can't recommend Parlour enough!"
"a chill-out bar that you should visit! the cocktail list, even though is not big, it is enough to satisfy all the tastes. the prices are normal and the atmosphere unique. the best time of the day to visit the bar is at around 8pm, you will most probably find a place to sit."
"I booked afternoon tea as a surprise for my Daughter. We always try to go somewhere different and this place has a reputation going back years. My first reaction was good. The interior was smaller than I thought it would be but done out in black, with mirrors, giveing it an old fashioned, yet charming feeling. We were shown to our table which wasn't laid up in anyway. It was a cream marbled effect in the middle of the square table, surrounded by a black edge. The black was all chipped and worn through to the wood and looked nothing more than a cheap cafe table. We didn't have a tablecloth, that is only for lunch and dinner. We had a choice of tea to drink but the rest of our tea was just bought and put on the table. We had to ask what was in the sandwiches. Our tea was very average for the money. I was disappointed with the overall atmosphere and experience. We had booked and were expected yet no table had been laid up for us. The cakes/sandwiches were good. I think there are much nicer places to go for tea in London."
"Very good moment for a tasty and healthy breakfast, very friendly service in a nice place, fantastic yogurt and good tea, very good cup of fresh fruit"
"We went to this restaurant last evening and got a window table, having requested this when booking. The restaurant was busy and the tables are quite close together but we felt, in the window, that we had plenty of space adn we could talk easily above the background noise. Excellent central location in Theatreland, of course.We all had two courses from the special pre-theatre menu. The food was very good, although the portions were not huge, but we felt that, for central London, it was good value for money.Our waitress, and others who seated us and served us, were all very friendly and helpful and did their best to offer prompt service at a very busy time of the evening. Definitely recommend and will be back!"
"I really loved this pub. It felt really comfortable, wasn't full of rowdy men and served really good food. I especially loved the beetroot and goats cheese salad. I think I had it about three times during my stay. The staff were nice but, because of the large amount of people, service was a bit slow and you seemed to have to wait a long time to get your drink. I am assuming when there isn't a large event on this isn't the case. It was definitely one of the nicest hotel restaurants I have been to in a long time."
"If you have not experienced Covent Gardens in London, it is a fun place to check out. In the middle of the grounds you will find Union Jacks. We shared a pizza which was OK. Although a very busy place, the service was also OK. It was a fun experience at a reasonable price."
"reasonably priced - for Londons Mayfair-, well cooked, traditional English fish and chips in a different environment than a classic pub!tried the Mayfair classic and it did not disappoint me. politeness of the stuff must be mentioned, the waiter definitely loves his job.well done Mayfair, well done London!!"
"We were there on a long weekend trip to London. We were lucky to get a table, as it was busy. However, the turnaround time is reasonably fast, so probably would not have had to wait too long. The service is friendly and efficient and the food tasted good. We ordered the kids burger for our 7 year old. To be honest it was too small for him but we should have asked what size it was. Pricing is also OK."
"My 2st time at The Wolseley & I love it. What a stunning room, great cosy little bar in the side. Very friendly at our arriveal, we had s great table. The food was delicious & the room ambiance was fantastic."
this is the worst restaurant I have eaten in - the food was awful and cold service was very bad would never ever recommend this venue to anyone.
We had a party of 11 for a leaving do. We had a good table with enough room. The atmosphere is relaxed and we had great food. I had the classic burger and the other 10 had the T Bone Steak. AMAZING steak! Highly recommend this restaurant!!
"Unions Jacks is located in the middle of the Covent Garden market area. The food was decent; however, I expected it to be a bit better considering that it is a Jamie Oliver restaurant. Definitely a decent food option when in the Covent Garden area."
Waited on a que for five minutes. Waiter got my order wrong so I had to wait 30 minutes to eat raw lamb. Not worth the money!
"I don't know who told this people that this is Italian food, but as an Italian - born myself, let me tell you this is not even close to it. A part from having to queue half an hour for a plate of pasta that not even in Caritas, as soon as I tasted it the pasta was overcooked, soaked in a sort of whitish liquid cream, completely salt-less..at a point that I had to do whatever in Italy is consider blasphemy...add salt to a cooked pasta! Third the salmon tasted like burn it was inedible and pretty disgusting. I won't even start with the industrial ""homemade"" tiramisu that I see as an insult to the real homemade Italian desserts, they should be ashamed of themselves and remove any mention to the Italian food.."
I heard about the Ice Bar from a Travelzoo promotion. First we had a cocktail in the ice bar wearing a cape and thick gloves. The only criticism would be that they allow too many people in at the same time although I didn't have to wait too long to be served.The meal later in the restaurant was superb. Not great portions but of great quality. Staff were professional although our waitress did struggle with some English words. Atmosphere was quiet. Some of the tables were too close together. This is one of the better restaurants in London and I recommend for an occasion.
"The meal literally took over an hour to come and we ended up ordering a take away instead, I'm not sure about the price for standard fish and chips, the fish is good but so is my local."
The decor is nice and the staff are attentive. That is where the praise stops. The food is average at best and is laughably overpriced for what you get. It tastes ok but the portions are miserable and the quality nowhere near justifies the price. I went because a friend wanted to go. Next time I'll insist we go elsewhere. Total rip off...
"I grab a Pret coffee every morning. It has been consistently good, they are reasonably priced, AND they don't charge extra for soya milk like some other chains."
The chicken salad was excellent- flavorful and filling. The roast beef salad was quite good. The beets were a disappointment. It was delicious with the horseradish. The house white wine was fine. The Black Forest gÌ¢teau was to die for! The service was excellent and the wait for a table short for a Saturday night. Prices were fair.
"Couldn't fault the service, they were incredibly courteous and attentive, The food was delicious, freshly prepared and authentic. Out of everything we tried, the only dish I would critique is the chilli mushrooms as they were a little too sweet for my taste. However all of the other dishes were perfect and I will certainly be going back."
"Family visit with two hungry kids and Honest Burgers in Tooting Broadway never fails to satisfy. Cooked to perfection as per indiveidual requirements, the burgers were delicious and even more so with the large onion rings and juicy chicken wings. Staff are wonderful and you get a real service with a smile feeling in a relaxed atmosphere."
"Starters came out very quickly, but so did the meal! We had barely 2 minutes between the two, and so the starters ended up sat there almost untouched. Also, the dessert was just a frozen thing that they'd defrosted, so not worth it.However... the main meal (we had the best fillet) was possibly the most amazing meal I have ever tried. The steak itself was huge. My partner and I ordered different butters, salts and sauces and basically mixed and matched. Every mouthful was a dream. The service was fantastic, with very friendly staff. One of them knocked my fries off the table by accident as he was passing, and couldn't apologise enough. 30 seconds later I had a brand new basket of fries. The waitress was lovely explaining about how to use the butters etc.If you want to try this at home, search for Steak Stone Lava Rock and you can easily find the exact tray that you are served. I will definitely be trying it!"
Good beer didnt have food. But its the olest pub in london and it has a very nice feel to the place. Staff are friendly and its just across the road from the travelodge...great as thats where i'm stopping
"My parents were visiting me in London so I quickly browsed Tripadvisor for good restaurants/pubs in eastern London. ""A pub amidst Michelin-Star restaurants got to be something special"" I said to myself and decided to give the 'Green Pea' a try. Service/AtmosphereWe Arrived way too late on a Thursday night and walked in just when Tom was about to close. I apologised, explaining that I wanted to give my parents a taste of traditional British cuisine, telling Tom that I would return the next day. Tom then kindly asked us in and kept his restaurant open just for us. He insisted we take our time, relax and enjoy the food - we should just leave the money on the table and leave through the pub next door. Trusting us like that even though he only knew us for ten minutes was quite astonishing! Tom was just wonderful. Charming, funny, patient and welcoming - more than I ever expected even considering all the spectacular Tripadvisor reviews. Also his two lovely colleagues were very kind.The foodPerfect. As simple as that. The first evening we had four different pies (my favourite was the Guinness/steak pie) and the second evening we had cottage pie, fish & chips and lamb shank with mash, chips and veggies. Superb. Even though I'm generally not a huge fan of mash, the cottage pie was spectacular. It wasn't the typical fish & chips wrapped in an old newspaper either but the luxury Tom-version: Whole fillets with wonderfully crispy home-made chips. Also the lamb shank was delicious; falling off the bone with a hearty, meaty gravy. Honest, fresh, traditional food prepared with all the Irish love in the world. I'll certainly be back soom!The prices are perfectly reasonable as well. Around 10-15GBP per person including main dish + chips + assorted veggies. Believe me, you won't leave the Green Pea hungry! Especially on weekends I'd recommend to book in advance to be sure to get a table."
"Seemingly in a restaurant review, one is not supposed to use the word delicious, but this is a tall order here. The blow-torched miso salmon tataki, sesame, ginger and pickles is exquisite, even if the miso is barely perceptible. The clever bit: grains of freeze-dried wasabi Ò mild and nutty, that titiveate the salmon. Next up, a marvellously executed chickpea and prawns in spicy tomato sauce with feta. Both prawns (impeccably local) and chickpeas are juicy, well cooked and flavoursome, and the feta does a deft job of taking the edge off the tangy tomato sauce. (The other word we're at risk of overusing about the food is ""balance"".)"
Wonderful service and lovely food. It is a good idea to book if you are squeezing in a meal before a show. We were a party of 6 and the service was so wonderful that we did not feel at all rushed. We noticed that queues for tables developed throughout the evening. The service was very personal and it did not at all feel like a busy chain restaurant in the centre of town.
Wonderful food and very friendly service at the Hungry Donkey. The wine list is all Greek but the waitress helped us through it and let us taste some options. The food was superb. Very filling. Charming manager (or owner?) gave us a delicious complimentary liqueur after the meal.
"A weird mix of very british socialites and very old-school media types, mainly in their forties. Occasionally very cool, sometimes very like your mum's birthday party, sometimes aggressive (think bob hoskins as an east-london gangster)."
"Beautifully positioned restaurant with views across Hyde Park. Lovely food, really well presented in just the right amounts with very careful attention to detail. Service a bit slow, sporadic and not always warm, hence the 4 not 5."
"What can I say, all I hoped for and more. Great cocktails (amazing and fantastically informed cocktail guru), authentic food (so much of it) and great service. We will come back again (will check first for the mac n cheese and cornbread). A great find especially if you love vintage style, we will be back. Loved this place so much my review doesn't do it justice."
"The pasta is very good. Very friendly place great for hanging out on a summer night, too. Kid-friendly."
"This is a small, very loud restaurant. They really pack patrons in tightly, and it seemed like everyone was just YELLING to be heard by people at their own table. The service was very slow. We were not all that hungry, so just had some ""starters"" and they were passable. The calimari was unlike any I had every had, and not in a good way. Their soup of the day was a Vegetable Soup (hmmm....vegetable soup in a seafood restaurant...whatever) and it was just OK. Even with only light food and two glasses of wine the bill was 42 pounds. The only reason we even came here is that it is close to the flat we were renting in Marylebone. We didn't try the fish and chips, but if the other food was any indication, they wouldn't be too good."
Really fun restaurant that turns into a great bar in the evening! The cocktails were delicious as well.
"Good, fresh and wholesome food. Definitely enjoyed it. A little on the pricey side but otherwise recommendable"
"Located on Wilton Street near Victoria station, this restaurant is a poor attempt to copy Burger & Lobster and at barely a cheaper price!I tried the signature ÏHardcore Burger, I don't know why, I think I was taken by the thought of having both a burger and some lobster.Unfortunately, the combination of the two didn't work for me at all. A waste of lobster meat, which is overpowered by the slightly burnt bacon and drowned in mayonnaise.My friends Ïhalf lobster on its own was apparently quite nice although don't be too liberal with the sauce, looked like it had split and was just too greasy. On the bright side, it was filling if nothing else."
"Visited with two friends for a pre-theatre dinner. We were seated and then totally ignored - we kept taking turns to politely get someone's attention and wait staff kept walking right by us. Finally the person who seated us, I think maybe the manager, came over to take our order. Two of our side orders were mixed up (with the wrong main) and one friend's side order of sweet potato fries didn't show up at all, so she asked for them. A while later the waiter came back with regular fries. Again, SWEET POTATO fries please. A good 5 minutes later he came back again while we're all just nibbling so our food doesn't go cold but not wanting to really start... The food was decent, quite tasty, although be aware that if you ask for your burger medium it will come out very pink. Overall ok, just a bit of an odd place, like the wait staff don't exactly seem to know what's expected of them."
My mother and I had lunch here after I'd enjoyed their afternoon tea on a previous occasion. We weren't disappointed visiting again. The hotel itself is charming and has real character. The bar area is warm and inviting with excellent service and a great range of wines and cocktails. We ate off the a la carte menu - had the butchers steak. It was perfectly cooked with generous portions - really tasty. The old school puddings were fantastic and not at all like how they tasted at school! Had the chocolate pudding with chocolate custard - best dessert I think ive had! The service was attentive without being intrusive and the dining area is relaxing and comfortable. Love it here and will definitely return.
"Been here a few times.. Cool vibe, good staff and great cocktails.However went here a few days ago and had all my cards stolen from my wallet.. Be wary when it's busy."
Wound up having a late lunch here almost by default as we were staying at their hotel and so glad we did. Crispy Aromatic Duck was done perfectly and sizzling beef was rich and wonderful. Staff was attentive and friendly with a great balance of attention and leaving you to enjoy your time in this most excellent non-traditional tavern. Their One Tun brew was excellent as was their gin drink by the same name.
"A friend and I went to dinner and ordered a Light tropicana pizza to share. When the pizza Arrived we were stunned: it was sooo tiny!!The waitress blatantly responded that ""light"" means half the size. So, you pay full price of a regular tropicana pizza, but are only served half of it!!Are we crazy?? When I buy light jam they don't sell me half the jar!! You Prezzo owe me half a pizza!! By the way, the quality of the pizza was terrible, you can buy a better one at ALDI."
"Situated in an iconic location, you can taste what real British food should be like. The staff is very friendly and gives elaborate explanations about what you can order. The food is served within a reasonable time and it tastes fresh. My ceasar salad was perfect and my husband enjoyed his steak a lot. The tomato soup is so good, makes you feel a child on a Sunday again.One thing you need to do is go to the toilet... Why? Well, maybe you'll finally know where 'crap' comes from. (Don't worry, the toilets are spic and span)"
"On a nice day it's a good place for a few beers outside while you munch on one of those chorizo burgers, YUM!!!Service friendly and a little crowded in the summer but it all adds to the atmosphere.Nice cask ales and nice clientele.Didn't try the food here but why would you when you can eat at Borough."
"This is a good place for lunch or a snack while shopping at Covent Garden. Prices are modest, so don't require haute cuisine just because Jamie Oliver's name is on it. The decor seems deliberately grungy, which struck me as a wrong choice, but perhaps it underscores the relatively affordable prices.A nice plus is the seat-heating system, which with the glass half-wall cuts much of the chill, Covent Garden being essentially open-air (even though roofed)."
"Enjoyable experience, good informal atmosphere, pretty if faded interior. Food excellent from pizzette to other delights so one can choose a plethora of things without feeling too guilty...."
"I have been here several times now and always enjoy it. The food is decent quality tapas at a reasonable price. I like the busy but small upstairs eating area best, but downstairs is not bad. The food last night included tender deep fried squid, nice meatballs, padron peppers, and kidneys. An enjoyable place for an informal evening meal with friends."
"The food took ages. The waiter appologised and explained the delay, which we understood, but then the onion rings came very cold.No one asked us how the food was, and there was no goodbye when we left."
"Hadn't been here for a little while and went Saturday before meeting people next door for drinks. I'd almost forgotten how different it was to the standard run of the mill restaurants you come across everywhere these days. Good quality, hearty food dished up with a fair degree of Blarney from Tom. Just what you need on wet blustery days. Good Guinness on tap and very reasonable prices too."
"We booked Gaucho for my sisters 40th birthday, we were made very welcome from the moment we Arrived until we left very merry!! And loud! There were 7 of us and so we did mange to try quite a lot on the menu, between us we tried 5 different starters all delicious the crab was outstanding, the steaks were cooked to perfection, I would say the only thing they should advise on is the sides as each one is more than enough for 2 people but we didn't realise this and so over ordered, our mistake though, we had a problem with one of the sauces we ordered but the manager sorted the problem out immediately and gave us all free shots and drinks for the inconvenience, they even let my sister to go behind the bar to make a cocktail, all in all a very enjoyable evening was had by all!"
"Dropped in for a meal on Friday evening. It was very busy but there was a very good atmosphere. It is certainly an experience not to be missed if you are in the locality . . . . . a blast from the cinema past. Large photos, mostly black and white, of the stars who would have been performing in the days when it was the Savoy (before the ABC) are on walls all over the place. There's a giant film camera on display too. We really felt that the lights would go down and the ""big film"" would be start. The Circle is up there as it was, but sadly there is no access. Food was hot, tasty and well worth the money. No complaints at all. Staff were all very pleasant and efficient. What more could you ask for?"
i had lunch here with 4 friends and the service was excellent.its not a huge menu but all very good quality.we had the a la carte menu but people on the next table were havinga set Xmas menu and that looked great too.theres the pub area and then a dining room upstairs which is where we were.very clean and cosy but difficult for people with mobility issues as its up a winding staircase
"Was staying in Greenwich midweek and visited Green Pea after seeing all the great reviews, glad we did the meal was superb and all home cooked and fantastic value. Will be eating here on our trips up to Greenwich in future."
"Normally I can't be bothered with reviewing restaurants. But when it comes to amazing restaurants or really bad ones I can spare a few moments to either recommend them or warn people about them. Recently, the experience at Vapiano London at 19 Portland street was not good.We just came back from Mexico city and the service and food at Vapiano there was so nice and personalised, the food was excellent we can't wait to go back to Mexico for holidays just to go to Vapiano there.The story for Vapiano London is completely different. It takes ages for you to actually place your order and you are standing waiting in a queue just for you to place your order, then when finally you reach the cook/chef at the section you have to queue again if you want another thing. In Mexico city the same system is in place but it is worth the wait when the food is nice, the people are nice and you can actually breathe and move around.The place was massively crowded. We had to queue for at least 25 minutes, and you cant talk to your friends. I believe you need to have a party of people with you so that while you order someone saves a table or seat for you. Once you take your order they don't put any effort in customer service or listen to you. I am allergic to milk and I had to repeat myself several times as the place was so loud, and the person that made the pasta put a bit of cheese. We also ordered a vegetarian pizza and it was bland , with few vegetables on top.At the soup and salad section when we ordered the soup the chef/cook was apparently just concerned about time, as she kept rushing us out and we couldn't express that we wanted to add croutons with the soup as she seemed to be upset that we were undecided on which kind of dressing to put in our salad, she didn't even bother to kindly recommend one when asked. The place has potential but we don't feel the price we paid for the food was fair given the experience. Standing up in a queue for 20 minutes just for a really bad Italian food is just not worth it. Next time Pizza Express will do or we will just wait until our next holiday and go to the amazing Vapiano at Mexico city.Do not ever think of going to this place to talk, take out colleagues or business clients for a meal , decibels there don't allow for conversation."
"We ate here one evening after the Gastech conference, there was about 8 of us the service was by a Pakistani lad with a brilliant attitude and he was very funny. We had about 12 starters and ate them as Tapas between us then we all picked different mains.The starters were brilliant and all our guests enjoyed them so much, the main course was served with a twist of Asian and multi cultural cuisine. overall the food was brilliant."
"We went to the anthologist for our company Xmas party. We booked the blind pig. Not sure whether it was company or pub s fault, but the room was definitely not suited for the amount of people in there. I did not like the room itself. From the website this is the description of the room ""a secret drinking den for the young darlings of london. inspired by the roaring 20s, sip from teacups Ò or bathtubs Ò brimming with gin served by gentlemen in smoking jackets & ladies in feathered headbands for a touch of faded glamour & old style decadence"". To be honest I find it a fancy description in an attempt of giveing a delicate touch to something that actually looks quite minimalist and sloppy. Food was scarce and averagish. Same for the drinks. All in all it was ok, but I was definitely not impressed.The pub upstairs was so packed that waitresses and waiters could not take us to he blind pig. The explained to us where it was and asked to be careful with our bags and things not to hit people who were dining.I would not go again, but that just my personal taste."
"We visited for a family celebration in mid December at the height of the Christmas party season so the restaurant was lively even though we Arrived around 7pm. While waiting for our table we had drinks in the bar area. An aspect they could improve is to have a dedicated waiter to take drinks orders as several groups were waiting to be served and waiters drifted by getting drinks from the bar for the restaurant. The meal itself was up to the usual standard of the Gaucho chain with all steaks cooked exactly as requested. As ever portions were generous. The restaurant is rather dark (a Gaucho style signature) and noisy enough when full not to have the somewhat blaring music intruding. The management should also invest in more powerful air-conditioning as the open kitchen generates a large amount of steam and smoke which pervades onto your clothes.Prices seem to be rising as we paid circa £100 per head including the 12.5% discretionary service charge which is itemised as ""gratuity"" on the bill - hopefully the staff are receiveing this.Overall consistent quality and a must for meat eaters."
"Many of the previous reviews will give you an idea what this restaurant is like. We have been here a few times and not liveing locally it's when we are in London that we can visit. It had been a while since we had been but coming back again it's sometimes difficult to remember how good this restaurant is and yes it really is excellent. The food, the wine, the atmosphere, the staff and their efficiency all get 10 out of 10. So if you want to spoil yourself, go here but please book, this restaurant is so, so busy it's difficult to get in without booking first."
"We weren't able to book a table for 8 people that week (to eat on Friday), so turned up and had to wait for 1hr to 90 minutes. The little pager was good Ò eased our mind that we were in the queue and would be alerted. Three beers later, and after a couple of sharing platters (as we were too hungry to wait any longer), we eventually got a table amongst a load of other empty tables. Food was alright, but as always with TGIs, the brand expectation and excitement about the food was better than the actual stuff."
"I first got into this place through Groupon, lured in by the prospect of a lobster burger. I was impressed enough to come back twice since, once with friends after a busy day in London. Like other contributors, I enjoyed the food, ambience, service, and the fact that all the staff from the lounge bar to the restaurant had a certain flair and a bit of class. I was impressed by the sophisticated range of world spirits and wines around, plus the fact that the barman knew a lot about them - nobody here gave me the impression of being a bored student just jobbing their way through college. When I asked about how to eat a lobster burger (and later the hanger steak), the gent serving me told me to do it how I liked - and that at 'Reform', they take traditional and classical ways of doing things... and reform them.ive enjoyed returning since for good food and service - must get around to trying out that free-flowing champagne thing...."
"Planned to get there but couldn't book as apparently it was not possible, only to realise it was when we Arrived at the half-empty restaurant at 7pm to be told the wait would be an hour. As one of our party absolutely wanted to get into TGIF we insisted and they told us we could wait at the bar (how convenient for them!) and got a table 20-25 min later i.e. after ordering a first round of drinks...Then it was the usual TGIF Friday's act: over-the-top overly happy waiter, not taking notes to take an order of 5 (ok, respect here, but I think it is a bit pointless to put this on your waiter when you have such a busy understaffed restaurant). Starters took ages to come, but not as long as the main. We my main Arrived, it was missing the prawn skewers, and I got a lame excuse to justify this: the ones that came with your steak were too burned so we are preparing new ones (who took again ages to arrive).Now the food did not compensate for the poor service. On the menu there are 5 levels of how you want to meat cooked. I asked rare, my girlfriend medium-rare and both were the same: medium. I didn't mind but then they shouldn't pretend they can provide this...So overall quite bad experience.Oh, and a LOT of table stayed free throughout the evening, not sure who ""booked"" them..."
"Thursday evening pre Christmas and the place was absolutely heaving. If you don't like people then don't come here. The noise, the smells, the eye candy all made this a night to remember. We had a large table and the staff coped admirably amid the chaos. We went Asian and the lamb cutlets were very special. Unfortunately the Black Cod was off but there were many other temptations that met our expectations. There's even a club downstairs for the after party which was also full to the brim and just added to the knowing feeling you were in a place to be in the centre of the city that's the centre of the world."
"I came here for dinner on two occasions and always ordered the Asian style noodles. They are decent and come in huge portions, and are also affordable and quick. It tends to get crowded though so it's good to arrive earlier to secure your tables. I'd recommend it if you want a quick and easy meal in London that won't burst the seams of your pocket."
Recommended for Malaysian who can not escape from Malaysian food while in London. Located in Edgware Road and easy to find. Good food and portion.
I imagine this place wished it was in Los Angeles. Pompous staff. Over-rated food. If you want to be judged over dinner then this might be the place for you. If you prefer a more authentic pan Asian experience there are two restaurants either side of this joint that will see you right.
"That was my first visit in that chain, but the first impression is positive!Local on Victoria is very spacey with nicely dimmed light. You can select table for two, with couches, or round big cosy tables for larger groups.My Nasi Goreng was very tasty, just could be a little big bigger. But the prices are very nice as for London. I was surprised how ""teas"" like lemongrass or jasmine are served. These are not tea with lemongrass/jasmine flavour, but actually an infusion of lemongrass/jasmine. I think ive seen it this for the first time - original and natural - I like it.Last but no least - do you know restaurants with nice, stylish interior and bathromm out of nowhere? This is not a case here! Plus for cohesion!"
"Visited here on the last evening of a 4 day stay in Kensington and after the ups and downs of the previous 3 nights of various eating houses we were blown away with the meal, venue, wine, service and value of this restaurant, it was simply PERFECT.I would like to thank the chef and staff who helped make 18-02-17 such an unforgettable dinning experience.This restaurant is well worth a visit and is certainly on my repeat list."
This is a place that is absolutely delicious and authentic with friendly service - I guarantee you will be back.
"Went there with some work colleagues. Have been to a number of TGI Fridays before and therefore know what to pretty much expect. Unfortunately, this restaurant did not live up to the others I have experienced. First of all, the staff really could not have cared less. Service was slow and unenjoyable. Secondly, the drinks. We all ordered (pretty expensive) cocktails. They were completely watered down - you could barely taste the flavour, let alone the alcohol. Having had exactly the same drink at other TGI's, there was a marked difference. Also, all my fellow said the same thing.So, unfortunately, whilst I would still go to TGI's, I wouldn't go to this one again."
I come here lots for a burger on my own and the food is WONDERFUL. The staff are always helpful and it's always clean with a lovely vibe. GBK Notting hill is 100% my favourite place to eat in London.
"Really nice pub in Clapham. The prices aren't ridiculous, super attentive staff and our Sunday roasts were great. Would highly recommend!"
"Never been to London before and a friend recomended this place. Set menu and half a bottle of wine for £16 pp.. Cheaper than I pay back up north in the sticks. To be honest, after a poor (and much more expensive) experience the previous day at Jamies' Angel I wasnt expecting much. Suprisigly, It was FANTASTIC. I opted for the steak and my wife the lobster and the food was beautifully prepared. Even the wine was very nice. The staff were great too.My only reservation about recommending the place is my fear that it'll get too popular and I wont get a table next time."
"I'm not a big fan of sushi but there is much more besides here. The sticks are grilled food, such as meat, seafood and vegetables. There are also very good salads. It's not cheap but if is all very well executed and the venue is very nice - lots of light and minimalist decor."
"I absolutely love this restaurant. The history, the old-fashioned (not to demean it in any way) interior is vibrant and interesting, and the food is delicious. Rules specialises in traditional food and offers something most restaurants don't. It is here that I have sampled very tasty food that I couldn't get as nice elsewhere - pheasant and rabbit for example. Highly, highly recommend!"
"Fresh and crisp sandwiches and great coffee. Spotlessly clean, smells good and service with a smile...best way to start the day"
"We ate here on Saturday afternoon before going to see The Lion King, fantastic service, attentive staff and the food was perfect, had the strawberry dessert too which is to die for. Great size portions and good value,"
Worth climbing the spiral staircase for the upstairs dining if you have the time to enjoy your meal. Some really good food options and a full service bar. Staff are very friendly and eager to ensure that you enjoy your meal - if anything is not to your liking - they will fix it!
"I have to admit I was initially sceptical about going to an Indian place for breakfast, but I was so glad Dishoom proved me wrong. The egg naan roll was simply out of the world. It had just the right amount of jam in it , Oh my god it was so perfect! It has got to be the most innovative breakfast item I have ever eaten! The house chai was as always amazing. I could drink theit chai like i drink water, and i never get enough of it. Prett amazing meal, I'm going to go back many many more times!"
"Tonight, Friday 21/09/12, the place was rammed (good sign 'cus the food can be really, really good) but the kitchen was put in an impossible position. Over-booking, especially with a large group booking, is no good if you can't service ALL the covers and you don't tell people who've booked days in advance that there will be a delay. They really struggled. Extremely slow and the staff looked fed up with it all. No-one in real charge on the floor. Sounds like greedy owners compromising standards. Duty Manageress (Mata) was extremely rude (fed up with it all I assume, so hoping she's not always like that) when she asked me what I expected my very heavily melted ice cream with chocolate mousse served on a warm plate to look like !! I said something like the asking price of £8 quid please. Absolute rip-off. Very miserable and arrogant with it. Come on Elliots, I know you can do better than this, but not with staff who can't treat customers with respect. It's not our fault !"
"We stumbled upon this place on a stroll around the Smithfield and stopped for a late lunch in the sun. We had very high hopes, having watched Russel Norman's TV series and bumping into him in a restaurant in Venice earlier in the year. Unfortunately, whilst the setting was pleasant and the service was fine, the food itself was sadly tasteless and unremarkable. On the plus side, the prices are very reasonable and it is fun to share lots of small plates. We shall probably try one of his other outlets in the hope that this was a blip, watch this space......"
"Despite some of the reviews, I decided to give this place a try. I was starving and figured it was as good as any other place in the area. Ordered one of the pizzas. It is OK but nothing I would rave about. Service was good and fairly quick. Problem is that when you put Jamie Oliver's name of something, people expect more and to be wowed. When we are are, it is a bit of a let down. Still, I didn't leave hungry and by the time I left, there was a long queue. At least I didn't have to wait either!"
Being a fellow Keralite residing in the UK I can quite happily recommend this establishment to my friends. The food is simple and traditional Kerala cuisine and much better than those I have visited in the past. The beef was a real treat and even my kids enjoyed the food which was a shock as they have never been so keen of Kerala food. Atmosphere was nice and service was ok keeping in mind that the restaurant was very busy. Sure stop on my next temple visit to East Ham!
Been here many time to sit down and to pick up pizza. They do delivery too. Nice Italian food. Standard menu with a few specials chalked up on the board. Good local option.
"Only ever had take-away or ordered food to be delivered at home and was never disappointed.So far, we have only tried the wraps from the menu, as well as an aubergine dip, and they never disappoint.Bread is made and baked in the restaurant, you can definiteily taste the difference with the cheap flat and ""plastic-ey like"" wraps you often get some kebabs restaurants.The vegetable wrap is particularly delightful, the smokeyness and abundance makes it our favorite, along with the falafels.It would be great if falafels could be ordered on their own, and not necessarily in a wrap.Overall: tasty, good value for money and authentic taste.Definitely recommend and will get from them again. Never tried from the other branches.Would like to pay a visit and eat in the restaurant soon too.Thank you! Keep it up guys!"
"One of the best restaurants of London for ramen noodles. Friendly staff, good service and very testy food. The place is not very nice inside but if you want to eat something original is a good choice."
"I think it is part of a chain, but not 100% sure. Hit half price drinks so that was an added bonus. Food was excellent, would definitely recommend. Service charge added on to bill, 4 drinks and 2 entrees for about 45 pounds."
This is a wonderful and very traditional restaurant. The oldest in London dating back to 1798. It is steeped in History and has an array of famous guests to boast of. However it doesn't need to boast! The menu is full of Game from the Rules estate. Whatever you order will be of the highest order. I had the Venison to start followed by the braised Ox cheeks. All 6 of us were well fed and merry and the bill was a very reasonable £413. I would 100% go back.Great experience and great food!
"We did a lot of research prior to our arriveal in London for the perfect Afternoon Tea. It was a special treat for our 21 year old daughter. The reservation was at 1pm. The first disappointment (of several) was that we were seated in a very small liveing room ....some call that quaint , I call it cramped. We were seated on a loveseat and one sofa chair pulled up to a coffee table. We ordered three tea services including champagne (I want to say it was around $90 per person). We were a family of three.The server brought us each a pot of the tea we had ordered and our token one glass of champagne. Then he placed a small triple tiered tea caddy with three kinds of finger sandwiches and a few sweets and the traditional krumpets with cream. We assume there would be more coming, but the server never checked on us once! Another person was seated in the corner and we tried to flag down the server but ended up having to ask the front desk to get him. We asked for more sandwiches and after THIRTY minutes he brought us three indiveidual sandwiches. (BTW they were tasteless and boring). We noticed the other guest received the exact same amount of food for one as we got for three.We were under the impression there was a small dining area, but we never saw it. We knew the hotel lobby was going to be small and that the bar was tiny by the reviews. But never did we expect such a poorly executed Afternoon Tea. I feel so silly as the other reviews seemed very good. The entire thing was a huge disappointment. We left and went to Harrods for a meal. (which is hip, lively and fabulous)...All in all, I would never suggest the Hotel Egerton for anything after this very icy and disappointing experience for Afternoon Tea. I wouldn't chance staying there...bad service, boring food and a terrible value. We are not cheap people and are used to high end luxury experiences. This was a financial rip off and at least an hour and half long...and leaving hungry. We were staying at the Ritz and wish we had Afternoon Tea there. It seemed much nicer, with everyone seated with their own tables in a nice intimate dining area. The food looked great and the tea and champagne flowing! It was dressy and fabulous looking."
"I had a casual business dinner and first arriveal impression was a surprise, noisy, downstairs from street level. But when seated it turned out to be a very nice place with a good atmosphere. Some high and low tables makes it more useful for a bit casual, not to official business dinner or any other informal nice evening out. The food was great, even my Texas friend was very positive about the stake served. Nice people, good food, good wine list and good atmosphere what else do you need for a nice dinner."
"We went to Rules late afternoon, midweek before a theatre show. We were greeted politely and shown to a quiet and comfortable corner table where we were served water and handed menus by a friendly and polite waiter. We are vegetarian and were given a menu with three starters and three main meals to choose from. We chose an amazing cauliflower soup for our starter and a delicious roasted endive with new potatoes, roasted carrots and parsnips for our main dish and I couldn't recommend them enough. Both dishes were stunningly flavoursome, cooked and presented perfectly and the recommended dry white wine accompanied it beautifully. The waiters were discreet but attentive at all times and made us feel very welcome. We went for a special occasion and although pricey it was worth every penny. Highly recommended."
"We visited here for a coffee on Saturday 7th September, having experienced the delights of Borough Market. The food did look delicious but as we had had a big brekfast at the hotel we were staying in and had many samples from the stalls in the market we only wanted a coffee.We ordered a black americano and a double espresso, first mistake.............would you like milk with the americano..................I asked for black!!! (this is a frequent mistake and one that particularly winds me up, if I wanted milk I would ask for it). The coffee was diabolical, so much so we left it. It was so bitter and weak it was unbelievable.The other thing that was off putting was a drain aroma in the building, not outside, just inside the building!!Wouldn't go back."
"Got there without the booking. Although restaurant was full they founf us a table and we were served very quickly. Food- as always delicious, no more to say! Absolutely great!"
Tasty Lunch option Yeeros are great. Fast service. A little expensive for the portion size. Would go again.
"Delicious fresh sushi in clean surroundings, ready packed so you know exactly what you are getting. A pack with about 15-20 pieces worked out about £8 to eat in or slightly less for take away. In central London this was surprisingly affordable even when compared with the supermarket. Would highly recommend if you like Japanese food."
"Firstly, the service was great. They were overly attentive and gave us a free starter and dessert when our meals came out 5 minutes apart, which was absolutely fine with me. Most importantly, however, every dish we had was underwhelming and extremely overpriced. I realise that this is Hackney and you are supposed to pay ridiculous prices for everything without question but 18 pounds for 3 extremely small chunks of lamb on some cherry tomatoes that I could've cooked at home for 2 pounds fifty and 7 50 for a pint of ale, seven bloody fifty!!! I don't usually complain, but I was really disappointed by this place. Your hard-earned cash can be more wisely spent elsewhere. Like MacDonalds on Kingsland Rd."
"They open at 6am!! Great for people like us staying at the Holiday Inn a block away and still have jet lag. The service from the gentlemen (i think the owner) was fantastic, breakfast was great tasting and very good price. More tourists need to know about this place."
"A hidden gem. I was almost tempted to be selfish and not write a review, to keep the place for myself.A varied range of Vietnamese food -- pho is simply amazing; always hard to decide what to pick from the menu, and I go for the same (pho dac biet) almost every time."
"ive always come here in my lunch break & at night with friends. Always liked it. But today I went in my lunch break, ordered a drink, appetiser & a main course. 15 mins later nothing Arrived, people who ordered after me their drink came a min later! I went and asked them then they said ok it's coming. 10 mins later Arrived with my main course & the rude waiter said the kitchen forgot your appetiser so I told him yes I'm sure you forgot the whole order so he turned to me and said ""that's not a nice thing to say you know!!"" So I said well you said the kitchen forgot my appetiser so he said and now you claim they forgot everything??? And that was it for me!!!! So forgetting the whole order and being rude!! Unacceptable ! Instead of apologising he's only rude! I'm seriously not stepping foot in this place again! Such a rude and arrogant waiter can't face that he forgot my order!"
"Great food, ambience and value for money. Tom's a great host and cook - everyone should have a night out at The Green Pea. 10/10 eatery."
"Sorry and not sorry for the capitals, but our meal at Jame Oliver's Union Jack was beyond delicious. The food tasted phenomenally and we all enjoyed our food. We had pasta, meat and deserts so we were able to really try out the menu. The staff were very polite and friendly. Only negative I could think of was the fact that it was rather noisy, but I suppose you have to accept that since the venue is right in the center of Covent Garden."
I went there when I first came to live in London. The food is made by a chef called MICROWAVE .staff is exploited. Only one good point : the garden in this location . It has been a really experience for me so if you want to enjoy a good moment go somewhere else as the grain shop which will provide you good fresh food or take a snack at gails bakery .
Excellent choice of menu. Good prices too. Have eaten at Cote in many areas and always had a good meal. Staff very nice and polite. Give them a try you wont be disappointed.
"Pret is a great find in London. Ate a number of these throughout our week in London. Grab lunch and eat at the park. Fresh salads, sandwiches and my wife's favorite Kale chips! The best deal for a meal we found in this expensive city!"
Although this was a gift voucherFrom the very first telephone call to the finish of our cream teaThe service was faultless The cream tea was fantastic only flaw is were not smoked salmon loversWe will definitely visit again when we come to London and try lunch and an evening meal.....or 2Many thanks
"I am struggling as to how to review this restaurant. The menu has great and very varied starters but the mains are quite limited and I think I would suggest that if you can't find a main that appeals go for 2 starters. The starters are very large, we chose the chestnut hummus-beautiful but huge and very rich £6.50 (half the size would be ample) and the fish soup with prawn crackers and caviar £5.50-superb, great value with a lovely pop of flavour with the caviar and fish roe. For the mains we had the speciality cow pie (with!), chicken kiev and wild sea trout with samphire and extra fries. If you have had a big starter you can just about manage the sea trout or the chicken kiev but the cow pie is too much and very rich with quite heavy pastry and a very rich sauce/meat mixture with the marrow to really round off the richness. Chips were lovely and moreish. Deserts were out of the question as we were all so full although the souffle was much ordered and looked good. We had a bottle of Carmenere at a very well priced £20.50 which was soft and smooth. We didn't take our picky daughter and discussed whether we could find something she would like....finally came to the conclusion there was one starter and one main she would like but it would be touch and go whether we would bring her here. Service was good. We will go back but not with picky eaters (son's girlfriend wasn't at all keen on the menu ,she's picky too) and our son who is quite open minded didn't find anything that really grabbed him but ended up really liking everything that we ordered. We will come back again but with a different approach- to just order whatever we like rather than feel we should have starter and main and we won't brink the picky eaters! Outdoor area was great but might not have been so good if lots of people were smoking, the heaters were brilliant to top up the warmth as the night fell."
"Staff are really friendly , food was great and filling and the cocktails were amazing too . Priced really fairly too ."
"Lovely place. The food is excellent! And the staff, especially Jaya and Suleman and Badia are the best!! They always look after us. And waqas is always on point to helping us!"
It's the best ribs in town. I try to find other restaurant but no one better than this!!This branch is not too crowded like Leicester sq branch
"We enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea at the Park Terrace Restaurant.The service was really good, every single member of staff that we interacted with was genuine and warm, smiling and ensuring our every need was catered for.The afternoon tea was lovely, plenty of choice and the food was so tasty - we were stuffed!I'd like to extend a special mention to the pianist who was playing on Saturday 16th July - an absolute highlight of our visit. An asset to the restaurant and made our tea even more enjoyable!Thanks!"
"I booked this on Travelzoo so managed to get 50% off which was handy as the food is high priced (not overly so - in line with many celeb chefs). The food was absolutely fantastic, I really enjoyed the side of Mac n Cheese, and the steaks were cooked to perfection. The portions are sized well but you will need to order sides as the mains are just one thing (i.e. just steak)."
"What a fantastic atmosphere and buzz this, the supposedly oldest restaurant in London, has. We had an early table on a Thursday night and the place was already humming when we Arrived at 615pm. The food is traditional English classics, like roast grouse or venison, beautifully executed, expertly served and thoroughly enjoyed! The clientele are a happy mix of visitors, business people and couples like us who just wanted to enjoy the food. Definitely a destination restaurant for me."
"The location is quirky but nice. Went there for a quick after work dinner and the food was good and good value, the staff were friendly. I thought the service was a but quick though and left very little time to pause between meals. Other than that a restaurant worth a try."
"I rave reviewed this place about a year ago. ive been back several times . The food the first time was fantastic but has sadly never lived up to that standard since. It's a bit dull and heavy, overly 'clever' and deconstructed too at times. The Cocktails are great particularly the Bloody Mary. It's pricey for what you get though. Tonight however it was the service that did it, it was so rude that it actually reduced me to tears. I ordered what in the darkness if the room I had read as pork terrine with picallili. I was served a bland, tasteless sphere of very wet, greasy shredded pork- it could have been anything actually, we both tasted it and couldn't workOut if It was in fact pork, fish, or chicken- rolled in what looked like alfalfa sprouts and floating in a messy 'soup'of deconstructed picallili. It was vile. I told the waiter that it was not what a terrine should be. He then silently turned on his heel, marched off to get a menu and just pointed at it. Yes, I had made a mistake, it said pate not terrine. (If anything I think it was actually neither pate nor terrine but rillettes) He then said at some length that everyone else liked it, no one else had a problem with it etc etc. With a grudging shrug it was taken off the bill. There was no need for this charmless display. It was needlessly rude and humiliating. The rest of the meal passed in a blur. My husband said his food was serviceable but dull, They won't mourn this I mSure, we are not the glam30 somethings they are targeting, But never, ever again willI go here. Just too rude at the price."
"Like many others we stumbled on Pix, whilst strolling the outreaches of Covent Garden.This bar/ offers really tasty pintxos or mini tapas. Help yourself to the dishes and they count the skewers they come on to calculate your bill. All very simple and very flavoursome, but for us, even as ladies, the portions really are miniature. We were initially drawn in by the churros on the menu, but the portions were small and served cold, so, in the end, we gave them a miss.All of which means it is easy to rack up quite a bill, perched on bar stools and high tables, which don't encourage you to linger. Staff were friendly and efficient, but the self-service format doesn't challenge them too much.I would love this place if the portions were a wee bit larger and the furniture more accommodating!"
"We had a great meal with fantastic wine matches, and amazing service...would have loved to stay loner but we had a show to catch. The staff fitted us in and our timing really well...and just across the road from Drury Lane. Highly recommended...especially the rib-eye and asparagus dishes."
"Being a fan of the pavillion I decided to check out their other location in Borough Market. We were not disappointed! Everything we ordered was fantastic. We have plans to visit again, I highly recommend!Adam"
Poor greeting on arriveal - pointing us to go upstairs - the upstairs restaurant was not particularly pleasant to the eye; dirty walls and carpet - hoover propped up against the wall. Had I immediately visited the ladies I would not have stayed. One couple walked out quite quickly after arriveal. Service rushed and mediocre food. Could not wait to leave - service charge included.
"My friend and I went to this branch tonight. I wanted to try something new but a lot of the dishes had seafood in them, to which I am allergic. I to,d this to the waiter and he sent the manager, Paolo, over. I explained that I was allergic and he said it was no problem, they could make the dish I wanted (yaki udon) without the prawns and fish cakes. My friend's meal came out and I waited, knowing that food comes out at different times. Paolo came over and apologized for the wait,meh said that they were washing Dow the cooking pans to make sure that there was no cross contamination whe they cooked my dish. I never expected that! My dish came out and it looked great, but there was no chicken in it (which there should have been). I asked the waiter about that and he said they must have thought I didn't want any meat at all, and that they'd make me a new one. I didn't want them to go through all the hassle, so I just asked if they could make some chicken on the side and bring it to me. Paolo again apologized and gave me two servings to make up for not having the prawns. He came by to check up on us numerous times. The food was fantastic and the service was even better!"
Went for my girlfriends mums dinner. Was seated promptly. Waited 20mins for drinks/starters orders - with other people who came in later being served before. Drinks and sides came - cant complain about the quality of the food. 30mins between starters for our main.. Pretty absurd tbh. But again - cant complain about the quality of the food. Advice - stick to takeaway/pickup service. Eating in the restaurant was a BIG mistake.
"Stopped by Scott's two consecutive days while on a leisure trip to London. We only happened upon this great little place by chance as we hunted for somewhere to eat a late (ish) breakfast. Sampled the full English (or a #4 on the menu as its known) delightful, filling and delicious fresh produce is used and presented with probably the best toast we've ever had. The breakfast element of the menu is served through to 11:30am, so if you're a late riser, or like us just taking it easy, then this is a fantastic place. Don't plan to eat any lunch elsewhere, as one of their full Englishes will see you right through to suppertime! Location: Scott's is right on the corner of New Row and Bedfordbury which is approximately halfway between Leicester Square and the former fruit and vegetable market in the central square of Covent Garden."
"we visited Chez Patrick for the first time. We were spending the weekend in London and had a most wonderful time in Chez patrick. The atmosphere was relaxed, Patrick was friendly, attentive without being pushy and made us feel comfortable. The food was excellent i had the scallops and Belsam had the sea bass and both were excellent. The wine was excellent too. I will definitely go back."
"We came here for the pre-theatre menu and were very disappointed. Took 49 minutes for our drinks to arrive starter took 3 minutes and then main almost an hour. The waiters didn't know what on earth was going on it was an awful experience-I would not recommend, especially if you're in a rush for the theatre!"
"We loved this place.All food is made fresh on the day and if there is any left over at close of business it is given to those in need.The selection is fantastic and prices are very reasonable e.g. 2 x hot chocolates, a sandwich and a croissant for 7.50 pound.The only thing missing is wifi and we would never go back to Starbucks again :P"
Have been here many times and im never dissapointedStaff are great as always Food is always good too!!!
"We went for a post Saturday matinee meal as a group of four - our third visit this year.We were glad we had booked ahead - as the brasserie was filling up at 5p.m. We were welcomed at reception and our booking was quickly found. Throughout the evening the staff were all excellent - pleasant, efficient and checking how things were going. Three of us had the prix fixe menu - reasonably sized portions and good quality dishes. The haddock and hake went down particularly well. The wine list is quite extensive and with a good range of prices.We find the experience here consistent and will go back again."
"Serves best fish and chips in London. Haddock, Cod. Take your pick. Portion is huge. Share. :)"
From the minute you step in it feels like you have gone back in time and stepped into a gentleman's club of old. Waiting upstairs in the bar its an added treat and a chance to order a drink before your dinner. The food is fantastic and english at its best.Great place that we will continue to dine at on a regular basis.
"A block booking for 10 and a birthday meal. As a parsimonious northerner I found the prices were quite reasonable and the food good. Portions were generous, particularly the starters, and the food tasty. I found the service outstanding. All the staff were friendly, accommodating and in good humour. If this restaurant was local, I would visit more often. The whole restaurant, including the staff joined in with a hearty rendition of ""happy birthday"", which suitably embarrassed the target of our affection."
"What a great night out. Food, wine and atmosphere. You ticked all of the boxes. Thank you to the staff at Rules for making our last evening memorable. Great steak!!!!!!"
"The food was great, BUT I was queuing at the bar & a man came up after me. The barmaid asked who was first, I said I was. She said ""well I saw him first"" the man said no she was first but the barmaid refused to serve me first. Absolutely disgusted with the way she spoke about to me. Totally ruined my visit."
"Top top top Japanese restaurant, super expensive as it always is when Japanese, but my word, what an incredible set of 10 dishes, I couldn't stop admiring chef's amazing work.I'll forget soon the £250 bill for two, but not the great impression that place made on me.If you are not a Kobe amateur, drop dead."
"In short, we used Star deal for £20 each(£45 all together with service charge), what I have paid its ok, not impressed, but the food was well presented and on time!i would be more angry if I would book a table for the special occasion...and paid double money because it's not worth it, it's overpriced. Service was brilliant, friendly stuff, hotel itself not really my cup of tea, so I don't regret trying just won't go back, I think...but I have good evening anyway as I didn't see my friend for a long time so next time we just try something else."
"There for Business dinner; top place, typic Italian place, top quality food, amazing pizza and starter; the buttata was organic and the Dior di latte mozzarella as well; type 1 flower and Himalayan pink salt;Simply The best pizza in London!"
"I popped in for a quick beer whilst staying at the Travelodge nearby. The staff gave a friendly welcome and the real ales were varied and well kept.If it looks busy as you walk by, note that the much of the seating is out the back behind the bar in the style of a garden courtyard. Well worth a visit."
"My experience was simply amazing! I had classic melt with onions and Nutella melt after!!! Staff was very friendly and helpful, next trip for breakfast!!!)))))"
"Came here for a late lunch with 5 other friends, had cocktails which tasted very watered down, I had asked for no ice in my cocktail but the waiter was quite rude and blankly refused. The food was excellent though and we couldn't fault it, everyone really enjoyed what they had. I do think the prices here are quite expensive for what you get though the portions are big this is not a posh restaurant by any means its an American style diner. However, I would definitely come back and have food here anyway as I enjoyed it so much, perfect for comforting food or your typical steak/burger American style food."
"Had some excellent pasta and the staff were good too. We buy pasta from here sometimes as well as some very good olive oil, this was our first meal here and overall we really liked it, the only moan we had is that the cost of the mains for the portion size was poor, couldn't fault the food it's just £14 for some pasta seems steep. Get the pricing sorted out and we'd visit regularly for a meal."
"We were visiting the Cutty Sark and thought we would pop in here as it look lovely on the outside and was fairly packed on the inside. My American friend well she was in awe. Peyton and Byrne has an amazing 40 teas on the menu and this is what English tea is all about. She is a coffee drinker but whilst in England it was tea. The bathrooms was clean. The assortment of cakes was impressive, from coffee walnut which is what I had my friend had tried the delicious cookies and meringue rolls. I would definitely recommend both for tourists passing by Greenwich. We then went on to the O2 to finish the day."
"After coming back from a holiday in Poland, we wanted a foodie experience that would take us back to the holiday, and so we came across Baltic for a last minute Friday dinner out...After checking reviews, menus, and photos, it became apparent that other people were impressed with Baltic, but the experience happily exceeded expectation.#1 Ambience: Photos online don't do it justice. Baltic looks and smells amazing, and as you come in, out from the cold, you are warmly greeted by low lighting, clean design, and good vibes.Tables are somewhat close together, but on a Friday evening (19:45 - 21:15) it was surprisingly unpacked (in a good way).Staff are fast and attentive, BUT you won't experience any frequent and unwelcome visits to your table for them to see ""if everything is okay with the food"". You are treated like a priority, but nobody is trying to rush you or cramp your style.#2 Food!!: It was *really* good. Here's a breakdown...Rosolie (herring salad with potatoes, apple, beetroot, and sour cream) - A beautiful balance of flavour and texture. The herring didn't stink out the plate, instead the sharp/earthy flavours of the apple, beetroot, and sour cream were inviting of its fishy saltiness. Similarly, the meatiness of the fish was pleasantly contrasted with the crunch of the other ingredients. Gravadlax (dill and vodka marinated salmon with potato latkes) - Although the vodka wasn't so evident in the salmon, this was a tasty, hearty starter (beware those of you with a small appetite). The potato latkas were well-cooked - crispy and golden on the outside, soft on the inside, and full of flavour - and the hollandaise-style sauce tied the plate together.Pierogi (potato, cheese and spring onion dumplings) - We had pierogi in Warsaw, but these blew them out of the water. Delicate doughy and crispy shells with soft, creamy (though not flabby) contents. A light side dish (we had the small between two) that I definitely recommend.Roast Haunch of Venison with honey-roast pear and sour cherries - The meat was cooked (medium rare) to perfection. This is a bold, wintery dish with rich, stimulating flavours. The sour cherries were what attracted us to it, and were, in the end, what set the whole thing off, providing a tingle right in the chops. Pear lifted the darker flavours.Karkowka (slow cooked pork neck with braised sauerkraut, split peasand lingonberry chutney) - The pork was succulent, saporous, and mouthwateringly fall-apart. The addition of split peas gave the sauerkraut an interesting twist, and it came very close to beating the best ever that I had in KÌ¦ln (but not quite!). This was a light dish with strong, but balanced flavours. Satisfying, and not too filling.#3 Booze: Tokaji Furmint 2014 Chateau Megyer, Hungary - This Tokaji is a goodun. Grassy, citrussy, and clean. It doesn't suffer from excessive acidity, and worked a treat with the cheesy dumplings and sauerkraut. Hot honey Krupnik - Ummm, this stuff is just amazing, and even better when it's warm. If you can't fit dessert in, get one of these instead.Overall, Baltic is a proper gem, very reasonably priced, AND the service charge goes directly to the staff. Woop. It won't be long until we go back..."
When we got to the steakhouse we made a reservation for forty minutes from arriveal as they were busy at that time when we went back they gave us a table at the lower level I must say the service was poor too long a wait for our order to be taken when I complained to the manager he said we didn't have a reservation originally then I asked to be put on the top level they said there are no tables available however I checked there were at least 4 tables available I let him know and he allowed us to have a table on the higher level there the service was very good and the food was exceptionally good
"This is a South Indian Restaurant in my local area. I have been driveing/walking past this place for years and never had any interest in it as it just looks 'dead' from the outside.One of my friends suggested it as he had heard the food is great so four of us went one evening.From the outside, not much to look at. Nothing fancy, a large sign with its name UDAYA which is clearly a large house that has had the front entrance/liveing room converted to a small restaurant with a small bar area. Very basic but spacious and well lit seating area. A good menu with a reasonable amount of food to order.We each ordered a starter each (I ordered the Squid Fry extra hot) and they were all brilliant. My starter was fantastic; freshly made, piping hot and absolutely delicious. All of our starters were great! No complaints from anyone.I then ordered a devil prawn and a vegetable fried rice. Again, fantastic and delicious. Just the thought of it whilst writing this up is making my mouth water lol! Again, everyone was pleased with their order and we all shared each others meals and again, no complaints!We all had the Mango Lassi each as well which was brilliant! Sweet, smooth and the right amount of mango.  Didnt try the desserts as we were full as the portions are a good size. I was well impressed.I then came back again a few days later with my wife and she absolutely loved it!Please give it a go if you want no nonsense home made food....I am sure you wont be disappointed."
"Four friends went for a birthday treat and had a fabulous meal. Our waiter was very engaging and friendly. The steak (sampler board) was delicious and there was no problem getting a couple of the steaks flash fried when the medium rare came a bit blue (only in the middles). Very sweet complementary dessert plate for the birthday girl too! A really lovely evening. Unless money is no object, it's not an every day affair but as a once in a while treat, yum!"
"Elliot's cafe is the perfect escape from the crowds on a Saturday afternoon in Borough Market. Buzzy yet relaxed. We had a long boozy lunch last week before a visit to the Tate Modern, sampling a good selection of their tasting plates which included a zingingly fresh cuttlefish in saffron and ailoi, the most tender and fall-apart braised ox cheek with savoy cabbage, and an outstanding goats curd and beetroot confection that was alive with flavour. The wines on offer by the glass are all organic and additive-free, and we particularly liked the Italian biodynamic 'orange' fizz which the waitress recommended in place of a requested Champagne, and an outrageously flavoursome cloudy IPA on tap was also a highlight. The two waiting staff, the French (?) girl and the male waiter were both really helpful and knowledgable about the produce. The only minor gripe would be that the scallop starter was just that - one scallop. Although it was delicious it felt rather stingy to offer just one for £8. Other than that it was a really different and delicious Saturday lunch."
The food is excellent and service was very good. Ate there 4 times in a 8 day trip. Great location. Great hot apple pie/ice cream and fish & chips.
Excellent food combined with excellent service. Very friendly and attentive staff. We had an wonderful evening.
We ate here all three nights we stayed at the hotel and did the same two years ago.We also had breakfast here everyday. The food is excellent. The menu is varied with choices of light meals as well as regular ones. The wait staff are outstanding.
"If you like food, visit this place. If you are a pretentious tw@t that needs fancy lighting and decor as opposed to good food do not go here. In China beef is a luxury. Any Chinese restaurant loaded with beef is rubbish! Old Street Chinese has everything you need. Lamb, rabbit, innards, hot pot, fish etc. N.B. The lady that wrote that it is unhygienic is evidently a hypochondriac who would be better to stay at home with her microwave ready-meals. If you are ready for real food at a good price you would be hard pressed to find a better gastronomic adventure"
Had a delicious lunch sharing Tapas with friends at this delightful little restaurant. We really felt like we were no longer in London. The food was fresh and the service friendly.
"Great place for priveate rooms, outdoor drinks by Parsons Green , indoor atmosphere and getting together with several friends"
"On a high street crammed with restaurants, Tootoomoo's funky decor, relaxed friendly service, healthy food and great atmosphere make it stand out from the crowd. I love their healthy pan-Asian menu and struggled to pick just one thing to try on my first trip....This is also true of the short but delicious cocktail list, fortunately we didn't have to limit ourselves to one of those. A great addition to the North London landscape and thrilled to hear that they've started delivering to my area."
"A nice looking place with very attractive cakes. Husband had the red velvet union cake and it was fab. I had the Valrhona choc cake and it was disappointing: dry, not sweet, burnt edges. Tea was £5 a pot which is mad, Regent Street or no. Still, a goo into the Oscar Wilde room and the abundance of white hyacinths and tulips in the hotel foyer made it all worth it!"
"Walking down Middlesex street, you wonder if any restaurant could be situated here. But once inside, the ambience, great food with attention to detail and amazingly attentive staff makes up for the shabby outdoors and street life. Do not be deceived, our experience was totally faultless. Service was first class. Would definitely visit again and again."
"My son and I came here for Afternoon Tea and had the most amazing experience ever. The service here was impeccable and the restaurant itself was beautiful. The quality of the finger foods they served was fresh and delicious and the tea itself was outstanding.Location is near Kensington Palace, which was perfect for us since we were touring the palace that afternoon.I highly recommend the Park Terrace Restaurant for afternoon tea and look forward to going back."
"It is just opposite embankment station, right on the north bank of the Thames. A perfect location. We went midweek for a birthday afternoon champagne tea deal and were very satisfied, it was great value. There was so much of it we couldn't finish it all!I'd gone for decaf coffee and was first brought one cup, but when I asked for a pot, they filled a teapot, and again, I couldn't finish it! There were not many people aboard, but that was fine by us, I imagine its very busy at weekends in the winter and all the time in the better weather. The staff were very helpful and very nice. The only negative is the awful music. We asked for it to be changed three times, and can't say it got any better! It seemed to be covers and lift music!Disregarding that, I am going back with a larger group for an early summer weekend lunch"
"Last night I ordered some food for delivery from Venerdi. I received both a text and an email confirming that the food was on its way.No food Arrived so I tried calling the restaurant, emailing and texting but I heard nothing back.I waited in all evening for the food and it never Arrived. Toast for dinner!Today I received an automated message saying that my money had been refunded - no apology or explanation. When my husband spoke to a manger he said that it wasn't their problem.I'm gutted that a local independent restaurant could be so rude to a regular customer."
"popped in for a drink last month before a meal at the Mal next door, served by a very surly barman, who, when asked what Lagers were on tap, received a reply of 'Can't you read!', needless to say we left and had a drink at the Mal. previously a regular at weekends, but will take my custom elsewhere!"
We had the set-menu: 3 courses for £ 15.00 - amazing food for an amazing price!! Food was excellent: very tasty and fresh (my mum and I ordered haddock but were told it was finished; we were offered mackerel instead - nice touch!!). Service was great: our waiter Dominique was very friendly and attentive. Ambience was really good. We can't recommend it enough....we'd definitely go back :-)
"The Princess of Shoreditch accommodated 20 of my friends and I in their upstairs dining room for my birthday this Sunday. The whole team there were so kind, polite, friendly and helpful with every aspect. I had to change the number of guests twice prior to and on the booking date and they were happy to do so for me. I felt like they really went out of the way to ensure that our meal was a great experience and exactly how I wanted it to be. They were so attentive that after I mentioned it was quite warm they turned up the air conditioning in the direction of our table to make sure we were comfortable. They also brought out a chocolate dessert with candles so everybody could sing happy birthday, which was really sweet and a nice touch.The food was fantastic! The roast dinners Arrived with ginormous yorkshire puddings, seasonal vegetables, roast potatoes, tasty gravy and beautifully soft cooked meat. There were a good few other options available to riveal the roast which looked fantastic too. The whole place looks smart and tasteful, very nicely decorated and furnished.My friends and I had a really lovely time! Every single one of our group commented that they had really enjoyed their food, thought it was great value and that they would be returning. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this venue to anybody! I'm so happy that was the venue I chose to celebrate at this year. Thank you!!"
"Treat yourself to the smart, beautifully-decorated restaurant (with prices to match), or just grab a table outside, as we did, with a takeaway. We had haddock & chips, freshly cooked, and a tea. Portions were generous, and the food non-greasy. A nice place to linger, but I liked my meal so much that I finished it in no time."
With some old river barges still in the docks it does not take a lot of imagination to see how this place might have been 100 years or so ago. Where warehouses once stood there are now blocks of flats and posh hotels but there is a certain pleasing calm about the place which is a nice contrast to the nearby City of London.
"A pre-theatre lunch for two - Arrived at 12.45 and it was heaving.This has to be one of the most consistent restaurants groups in the South. Went for the usual set lunch - on this occasion a starter and a main. The soup was, as usual, very tasty and the largest whitebait I have seen was obviously freshly cooked. This is the advantage of a restaurant with such a big turnover - attractive options which always seem to have been freshly prepared- aided and abetted by swift service. Do like their system of 'runners' bringing the food from the kitchen as soon as it is ready, which is immediately pounced upon by one of the waiters and delivered to the appropriate table without delay. 2 courses was enough so topped them off with fresh mint tea and and an Americano - quite the best tasting coffee I have had out for months.This chain specialises on a quick turn round and you may want to consider other options for a quieter, more relaxed occasion - after all, this one is right in the middle of theatre-land. Just a bit noisy."
"ive been here many times but probably won't again which makes me pretty sad. Service was very poor - dishes arriveing randomly with long gaps in between. At one point exceptionally loud music was played for about half an hour. Inexplicable and inappropriate. We were hassled to leave after a couple of hours, despite not having got around to the desert menu. Food was still good but the ethos, welcome and ambiance has gone. What a shame."
"Been to Busaba a handful of times and it's nice enough however, I'll never go out of my way to go here.It bears all the telltale signs of Alan Yau's ingenious factory line approach to asian food. Some of the dishes are more authentic tasting than others and the portions aren't too bad. Atmosphere is quite nice although I never like sitting on tables with randoms (genius from a business POV tho!). Bottom line, there are loads of places to get better Thai food in London, so would only really consider Busaba if options are limited. My most recent visit is a prime example - needed something in a rush and something different as had maxed out on other cuisines at the time."
"I""ve been twice over the last few months. The first time I thought that the food and service was average but the last visit (and it will be the last) was pretty bad. My wife and I went with friends and the service was chaotic (they don't seem to have clearly assigned roles and you end end up asking the same thing several times to different people). The food was average and the value for money was below average - £14 for a couple of small skewered prawns and chorizo pieces over a bed of over-cooked tabouleh - not great when decent value is at the forefront of many people's minds. My wife's monkfish was under-cooked and returned. If you do go, stick to the burger which can't really go wrong. On the plus side it's good for families with younger children."
"Ok this is based on one visit but first impressions are so important.My wife and I went for a drink and after waiting twenty minutes to be served pricey cocktails, we had to wait another ten minutes after finishing for anyone to take any interest in us.Nothing disastrous, but when service is automatically charged in circumstances where service is non existent, I find It galling. So I asked for it to be removed from the bill.In response I got a snarl and my card grabbed off me and not a word of apology or even a query as to why I didn't want to pay for service. This was a terrible response and missed an easy opportunity to make amends simply be being polite.I wasn't actually trying to avoid paying for drinks, so the bar did ok out of me I guess. It's just a Shame the staff thinks service starts and stops with pouring a drink into a glass when competition for business round here is so fierce"
"Went following our completion of the London marathon and it was fairly busy. After a 20 min wait with our buzzer we were given a shout to go to a table. 30 mins later our order was taken, then food came shortly after but the drink ordered took 20 mins to arrive. When we had finished we waited for 30 mins before seeking out someone to pay for the meal, we were on the brink of just walking out without paying. The service was shocking."
"Cosy welcoming Spanish Restaurant and Tapas Bar. Reasonably priced and made to feel welcome. I was on my own as I was in London for business, however I was offered a discreet table and service was excellent. Fresh fish selection was excellent and I'd recommend the Paella. Because I was on my own I had the prawns pil pil as a starter and was not disappointed. Lovely atmosphere, could not fault it. Would definitely return here if ever I was in the area again. A family sitting close by had sardines and they looked delicious. Excellent Fish and Meat choices and an impressive selection of Vegstarian Tapas too. If I had spent another night in Pimlico, I would have gone back for more!"
"Just a perfect meal, great simple food. Good service. Highly recommend this restaurant . Great value"
"Booked the hispaniola for my husbands 30th birthday. We were a party of 4. On arriveal there were no window seats available. We asked if we could wait and decided on cocktails at another table before hand. Half price cocktails in October. once a table was free we were moved to a window seat with views of the London eye. The waiter for the evening Alejandro (excuse my spelling) was brilliant. Very polite,funny and kept the cocktails flowing. The food was good. For my husband the portions were small but he ate three courses to make up for it. We were the last table of people but they never rushed us. Will definitely visit again."
"i went to al basha restaurant with my family with groupon deal six taster menu food was really nice big selection of starters and mix meat and chicken plate was very nice , meat and chicken was full of spices and tinder we enjoyed our meal in good atmosphere kind and friendly staff  highly recommended place"
Wandering around Liverpool Street station and are came across several restaurants in Spitalfields Market. Chose Giraffe as menu looked reasonable.Fish & chips was overpriced and quite dire. Far too much batter and soggy too.No draught beers available and bottles were expensive. Onion rings were quite nice. BBQ Chicken & Smoked Cheddar Quesadilla was reasonable but not great. Unlikely to use this chain again.
"This was our first visit with friends, who had been before. Visited on a Saturday evening using Travelzoo voucher. Upon our arriveal we received a warm welcome from lovely staff. Our waiter Daniel was very attentive and engaging. Started with a cocktail, followed by four course meal. We thoroughly enjoyed each dish, all cooked & presented to a very high standard. Well done to the Chef & kitchen staff. The Restaurant surroundings and ambience delightful. A big thank you to staff for a lovely evening. Would thoroughly recommend the Restaurant."
"We visited as part of an experience day package and was pleasantly surprised how perfect the location is. The food whilst tasty was in small portions with very little veg it has to be said! We had one drink each and taking into account the meal was prepaid we were disappointed to be charged nearly 17 quid for a bottle of beer, a single vodka with coke and entertainment which was a cd playing on the background (6.50) !! It was worth it for the view though but would not hurry back."
Best curry ive had in a very long time. Great service. Every dish was perfect. We'll definitely be back soon. Almost didn't write this review as I want to keep it all to myself but feel the need to share.
"My girl loved the bangers and mash, and plenty of it.. My duckbreast was good, but the potatoes were better at Cote in Covent Garden - so was the service also. Good but pricy lemonade, from a bottle. Were an acident, a old man fell and pushed my chair to the table so my arm was lightly brused. The man bled from his arm and sat right beside us so we couldn't continue eating. Nobody checked how we were doing, and fellow diners help us to move to an other table. Bad service especially since I was eating With a 6 years old."
"Androuet is a very fine cheese shop with a seating area within Spiralfiels Market where one can have lunch (I believe it is only open for lunch on Thursday and Friday so check before you come). A friend and I shared a plate of six cheeses selected by a charming and knowledgeable young French waiter who explained the cheeses in the right level of detail along with a suggestion for the order in which to try them. The cheeses were all first class but what, for me, stood out was the warmth of the service on this particular occasion. We finished the meal with some excellent espressos. If you love cheese and are in the area, a cheese based lunch here is strongly recommended."
"We had a great dining experience!Not only was the food amazing, but our host Arif took excellent care of us. We would absolutely recommend Chettinad to anyone craving South Indian cuisine"
"Visited on Thursday lunchtime. Pub empty but advised that we were just ahead of a reserved party (of about a dozen who Arrived half an hour later). Consequently:- no food (not even sandwiches)- no beer- no water- no iceManaged to pull together some lagers, orange juice, Coke and crisps. Good job the area is being regenerated - first up against the wall. Grim!"
"Decided to go to Covent Garden for dinner and came across this restaurant. Having eaten @ jamies italian in Liverpool several times we thought we'd give it a go. We were directed to a basement which was cold and virtually empty( 1 other couple). The young man who seemed to be only person front of house was very pleasant and efficient but that didn't make up for the very limited choice on the menu. It is supposed to be in praise of British food... Pizza? My husband ordered chicken but was told it was off the menu. I had fish and chips; fish was okay, the pea puree was cold and it was expensive for what it was. They didn't have the Sauvignon Blanc I ordered but the recommended English wine was pleasant. needs to be much better before I go back."
"We Arrived just needing a quick meal with some friends who were visiting from Miami. Our host was Metti, who took care of us with an attentive and professional manner. The food was lovely, although the portions could have been bigger (my normal complaint with most places). All in all it was a fun relaxed evening attended by pleasant staff especially Metti. Thank you!"
"My carniveorous cousin took my vegetrarian self to Villa Bianca where we dined outdoors upstairs on the balcony on a balmy July evening. We were both spoilt for choice by the varied, slighty retro menu. My cousin always opts to sip semillon blanc or similar while I'm strictly shiraz, so a fine selection of wines by the glass meant that our divergent of tastes were well-satisfied. The food was excellent and the service attentive but never intrusive. Thanks to my generous cousin, I don't know what our bill was but menu prices were mid-scale. For the quality of the food and the overall pleasure of the dining experience, my impression was that Villa Bianca offered extremely good value."
"Staff was courteous and helpful with directions. Showers on the first floor of the hostel barely trickled any water and had rapid fluctuations of heat that ranged from ice cold to lava. The second floor showers were better. Bathrooms lacked hand soap. Part of the reason I went with this location was because of the food and drink specials. When I requested the wing special advertised on their website, they stated that that was an old add that was no longer honored. It is still advertised as of the day of this post. A spare mattress on the floor of the room had a huge blood stain on it."
"We were in London to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We had a bottle of champagne with meat platter, cheese platter of 3 cheeses plus chips. Everything was superb. They then brought out a lovely touch of Happy Anniversary in chocolate on a glass plate with a little fudge. That's what I call great customer service. Thank you for making it so special."
"I reviewed this restaurant a year ago and gave it four stars. So what has changed? Basically it's more expensive and the service was terrible. Staff were disinterested in providing us with a good dining experience. Granted they were busy but even getting a glass of water was a trial, let alone more pancakes for the crispy duck. Food was good but didn't justify the high price. Verdict: avoid."
"Decided to try this place despite poor reviews as we tend to be open minded. Unfortunately the reviews were v accurate.The service was average, often forgetting we were there.The dim sum itself was great, really tasty, good flavours and a good selection of choice.The main course was shocking. No flavour in the noodles, clearly been thrown together quickly. We couldn't eat them as they were a waste!I'd suggest only going if you order a good selection of dim sum, otherwise avoid"
"Went for the time after moving to the area a few months ago. I have not been to other local Thai options, but I have been to many elsewhere in London.The restaurant is smallish, with nice decor downstairs, while a bit less appealing in the upstairs room. The menu is extensive, even if not it does not deviate much from standard Thai fare, so if you want the more unusual or inventive Thai dishes, this is not going to be the place... However, when it came, food was good, if not unforgettable.Service is ok - we felt left alone at times, but it might have been due to being upstairs rather than in the main dining area. Prices are average, not cheap, but certainly not offensiveWould come back, would not run back"
"Yesterday my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed a delicious afternoon tea in the beautiful lobby of the Corinthia. I was particularly impressed with the gluten free menu. It is very good indeed with sandwiches, scones and cakes being flavoursome and beautifully presented. The staff were friendly and helpful."
"A real step back in time - class surroundings - courteous and friendly service (not a whisper of that dreadful ""no problem"" retort that seems to be a feature of contemporary ""customer service"") - proper food - decent wine.............Yes it's expensive but in our view worth every penny.............."
"I went to this restaurant twice while I was in London. First time I tried the veggie Burger (Portobello) and it was very tasty. Second time I tried a cheese Burger with blue cheese. It was equally good.Nice atmosphere, good service, good food. Very Good place to go for burgers while in London."
Perfect quick cheap lunch. Also very tasty! Service was quick and friendly. We had the pastrami and lamb toasties which were delicious
Nice to see the original owner re-open the Udaya after several months of wondering what would have to the place. The menu is slightly more mainstream in some respects but the southern Indian dishes are still there (though sadly not the squid fry which I loved).The quality and service are what you'd hope for. Welcome back.I just wonder whether they need to advertise a bit more and blow their own trumpet. It would be nice to see some themed evenings there as they're deserving of a wider audience.
"Freshly cooked and deliciously prepared. No ""best before"" date on any of the food. Prepared today, eat today."
"This was the most delicious meal we had on our recent trip to London. The service was excellent, and the steak was some of the best ive ever had. We were able to finish our meal and take a leisurely walk through Covent Garden on our way to see War Horse at the theater."
"This was authentic Greek food and a great selection the quality was great but the service a little slow, staff were very friendly."
"We went for lunch as a group of friends, booked to have the set price lunch at £37 per head. There is a choice of 3 dishes for each of the three courses, although one for each course had a supplement - why? The supplement price was not included on the menu and I see that a previous reviewer had the same menu for supper, with a glass of fizz, for only £28. Their comments regarding the duck and hanger steak are exactly as we thought. The staff were friendly and helpful. The a la carte menu may be better but I cannot recommend this menu - we get better food locally where a 3-course lunch is £15 and the fixed price is exactly what it means!!"
"I went to this club with some friends, we had been in the club for a few hours and the service was noticeably poor - slow drinks service, rude staff, etc... When we ordered the last round of cocktails we waited over 30 minutes for them to be delivered - at which point we all decided to move on to another club. We offered to pay and leave without receiveing the drinks at which point we were advised not to pay and to leave the club immediately.I don't think a small group of people having a quiet evening out should be treated so rudely and receive such poor service, so I would like to advise potential patrons to avoid this place. There are other clubs in the area which offer service with a smile and will appreciate your business."
"My office recently relocated from Soho to West Kensington, meaning that I had to forgo my usual lunch choices. This upset me greatly, as the best pizza you can find in London can be found in Soho, and pizza happens to be my favourite food.Fortunately, respite came in the form of Pizzicotto. Its staff are friendly and know what they are doing. The pizzas are even better, and, whilst not inexpensive, are worth every penny... the Margherita Pizzicotto, with its basil salsa and unctuous ricotta topping, is just sublime. I did briefly think it was the best pizza I had ever eaten, but I think I'd had a bit much too drink. Regardless, fantastic - I love coming in and will keep coming back for my work lunches. Thank you."
"Excellent Italian Pasta & Pizza. Salad was yummy too! Nothing like warming up after walking all over the Tower of London and Tower Bridge with a lovely glass of wine in a cozy restaurant and dining on excellent pasta served by smiling, happy waitresses & waiters who make you feel like family! Excellent food and service. From the USA. Travel the World in my job. Very pleased with the food and service. Give two thumbs up to this restaurant for excellent food and service. Very pleased."
"Loved the place, the food and the service. Great value for money, very authentic and interesting cuisine."
A nice meal to end a long friendship with this resteraunt as it is closing next week but bare in mind it is pricy. If you can get there before it shuts I recommend it
Worst pizza ever eaten. It looked and tasted rubber. We felt bad all night. I do not recommended it.
"we had dinner at bar boulud . we have dined at several of his restaurants in both the US and Asia.. Bar Boulud is a casual bar setting as the name suggests great for pre or post theatre or in our case after a day of shopping. The meal was excellent. we dined on scallops which were so tasteful and prepared perfectly (moist, sweet and tender) and lemon sole rosettes wrapped in herbs that were absolutely delicious. we enjoyed a very good glass of Medoc house wine with dinner and a amazing lemon souffle for dessert. location is great as it is close to Sloan St, Harvey Nichols and Harrods. we travel to London frequently and will definitely return."
"When back in London on a visit, what a slice of nostalgia this restaurant is! Long may it continue. I hunger in anticipation of a steak and oyster pie."
These small cafes are all over London. The food is made with mainly local organic ingredients and is fresh and delicious. We are many breakfasts and lunches at the one acros from our hotel. Their soups are yummy as are their sandwiches. Breakfast items are plentiful and the coffe is excellent. Al of the food that they don't sell at the end of the day is given to local shelters. Great place!
"Clean feeling restaraunt with good decor.We ordered calzone, pastas, pizza and calamari, all were very good and the pizzas were huge!Service was quite quick and efficient but the drinks took ages to come."
Met friends here for dinner mid well and it was great. The place is located right next to kings x station which is very helpful and it had a great vibe. All the plates were nicely presented and tasted amazing. We had a minor issue with a corked bottle of wine but this was resolved easily by the staff and we had an enjoyable evening.
"Recently ate at this restaurant, its a lovely family run Italian restaurant with fabulous service but most of all excellent food. Good selection of wine without the rip off prices. Fantastic value for money and definitely worth a visit. Highly recommended."
"Was staying with some friends in Greenwich who had been to this place before. We had a huge and delicious sunday brunch in a quirky setting. Relaxed, friendly and cheap! What I really liked was the non pretentious ambience and the very friendly Tom who has the nicest Irish accent and is amusing and knows about good customer service. I hope to return when visiting again and try out the much praised Sunday lunch."
"ive met a friend here for brunch recently. The venue is absolutely lovely with the great terrace on a quiet street, which takes you away from the hustle and bustle of New Bond Street.We've had eggs florentine and a full English, and both meals were cooked wonderfully.Service was impeccable. We will certainly return."
"We enjoyed our evening in CÌ«te, very helpful staff, very good food, good ambiance, reasonably priced for a prime area in London."
"We have visited twice but only in the evenings so had no problem with noisy children. Our experience differs from your other contributors in that we had excellent attentive service and were even checked on by staff serving other areas of the restaurant. Again we have only ordered pizzas so can't comment on other dishes but we thoroughly enjoyed ours, which was served hot, bottom crispy and very tasty. Our opinion, among the best of the pizza chains. Noise was a factor but we put this down to the lively clientele who were mainly young women in groups or pairs, enjoying a conviveial meal and conversation, out together. My advice, don't be put off by the reviews, try it yourself."
With the help of the staff and their suggestions we had an amazing meal! Food was great and quick. We would eat here again
Really great pub with excellent live music on Thurs/ Fri nights and an buzzing atmosphere.@secret_streets
This pub was right at the corner from where we were staying so we had to go in and try their pies.Glad we did as they were delicious.as were their chips.Nice friendly local bar...
"My husband and I came here for our Valentines meal. I had pre-booked and had asked for a nice window table. When we got there all the window tables were taken however lucky a couple were just leaving so wesat at the bar for 10-15 mins while they left and the table was cleared. The views were spectacular, a great view of the London eye. The service was overall great and they had lovely cocktails. The food was mediocre, not spectacular but tasty. The food wasn't very plentiful (I was comfortably satisfied even after three courses!..My husband on the other hand..) The atmosphere was nice and romantic and I recommend for a special occasion."
"Being born in Brazil and having visited Argentina in several occasions makes me a bit fussy when it comes down to meat but this place was spotless! The restaurant has a great location and it made a really nice spot for a catch up with friends that work in the area. We all ordered different cuts and each single one was cooked to the point of perfection. Tender, succulent meat, very well seasoned and presented. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a descent meaty meal - which is really hard to find in London. Our waitress was brilliant, recommended drinks and sides and had a really nice attitude, always smiley and friendly. The manager (young girl) came to our table to check on us. which makes a huge difference as it gives you a sense of the place being under control. The only low point of our evening was the tables being too close too each other. I sure wasn't interested in what the table next to us had to say about their evening in Birmingham! But would definitely go back"
"...(which, of course, does not feature on chippy menus south of Watford), this was a really nice surprise. Service in the restaurant was quick, food was hot and the light batter was amongst the lightest ive ever experienced. Rock salmon was a first for me and ""interesting"" in terms of texture and flavour, and a whitebait starter didn't disappoint either. I'm sure I'll choose to return here with friendly foreigners who want to sample some fine British cuisine whilst visiting London."
"The only trouble with this place is, you won't want regular British Indian food again after eating here! Offers special dishes rarely seen in other Indian restaurants round here, eg Papri Chat and Gajjar Halwa. ive been going about monthly for a couple of years. Food is beautifully presented and is always tasty. ive always found the staff friendly and helpful although one of the young staff is still working on her English. If ever there is a problem, they sort it out with a smile. I'm not kidding - every other Indian restaurant has been a bit of a let-down after this."
"The burgers taste good and they are quite big. My girlfriend's salad was huge! And it was really fresh and tasted good. Don't worry about leaving hungry. Nice fries and sides. Perfect for lunch, but maybe not for dinner, not cosy enough. They have some ales to choose from."
"I always enjoy Our lunches at Rules restaurant because the Food is tasty and good portions, but what I like best With Rules is the really excellent service! As London's oldest restaurant it has lots of old atmosphere in the air and on the walls."
"Went there for a quick meal, we really enjoyed the atmosphere and service. The staff were friendly and were chatty"
What can I say. Tom is a true pleasure to meet and a great host. The food was good old fashioned English grub cook perfectly and extremely good value for money at under £45 for 4 with dessert and he also gave us some free chocolates and coffee. Super
"Following a concert at King's Place, we went looking for a place to have lunch. Restaurants in Granary Square were either full (there was a huge queue at Dishoom) or incredibly noisy. My friend is a vegetarian, so we were impressed by the Grain Store menu. It was busy but we managed to get a quiet table. The food was really imaginative, particularly for vegetarians. Not being one, I had the brunch platter of sausage, egg, and mushroom while my friend had creamed avocado on toast with perfectly-cooked scrambled egg. There is a bit of hyperbole in the menu descriptions, but the food itself was excellent, as was the service. Prices were reasonable for the area and they did not slap on the usual 12.5% service charge. Recommended."
"As we were staying at the Millennium Chelsea Hotel, we booked to eat at Marco's on the 5th May - and at the time of booking, not knowing that it would be FA Cup Final day (the significance of this will be clearer later in the review!). We were sat in a nice booth with lots of space. I had the potted duck to start which was lovely and the portion size was enough to share with my husband. I had lamb and dauphinoise potatoes and my husband had calves liver and his favourite spinach with garlic - both dishes were really good. We also ordered the triple cooked chips as wanted to try them and they were the best chips we had ever tasted - fluffy inside and extra crispy on the outside. Unfortunately we didn't get chance to sample the desserts as were both full. The wine, albeit a little bit pricey, was excellent. However, the grand finale of our evening was when the FA cup was brought into the restaurant and we were able to hold it and take photos - what a memorable experience - my husband hasn't stopped talking about it since we returned home. Definately going back when we are next in London in September and it probably won't be so eventful but the triple cooked chips will still be there!"
"Haminados has been one of my favourite cafes for years! The food is so fresh and tasty and the price point is excellent for the goods provided. The owner (Joseph) and his family are incredibly welcoming and so lovely and the workers are genuinely nice people. Couldn't love it more, strongly recommend."
"I had and have high hopes for this place. He uses Chinese/Asian kitchen staff, has SE/Asian ingredients on sale and seems to genuinely love these cultures and his representation of them. The taste is not bad either. The only drawback is it's expensive for what it is. The other day I ordered a salmon/tuna/avocado roll to go for my little boy, who will not eat one from M&S across the street, and ended up paying £13 for it. I love his work in the community, which alone is almost good enough for me to be a regular; but the pricing needs fine tuning. Fundamentally the difference between 2/3-time patron since the place opened and what could be at least once-a-month patron."
"This is by far, without doubt, the oldest and most traditional restaurant in London. I was so happy I got to know this place! A trip to London is not complete without a stop here. Food is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. A traditional English restaurant that actually tastes good! I don't quite have the taste for british food in general... But, I had a rabbit dish that was so good I forgot I was dieting! LOLThe meat are very fresh, the beer is served old style in silver plated cups.I could have order lots more! Will definitely be back!"
"We were wandering around Covent Garden and happened to fall over this place. Had to queue for 15 minutes or so but no great issue. Served typical English food, fish and chips, steak, etc not overly large menu but something for everyone. The staff were pleasant and service was very quick. My 10 year old daughter, usually quite fussy, had no problem finding something she liked and my 16 year son said his steak was the best he'd ever had. Good atmosphere with street music going on in the background. Certainly would go back if we are in the area again."
"Groovy restaurant , great food, yes its expensive for what it is BUT it does it very , very , very well. Cool decor, great atmosphere, big portions...you could take anyone here from your inlawa to your kids and they would all have be in awe of the food and decor! and you would have a great time...."
My friends and I came across COUNTER after looking for a place for bottomless brunch. What a find! With it's super friendly and speedy service and unlimited Prosecco it's the perfect start to any weekend! Since then we have become frequent visitors whether it be for after work drinks relaxing in the comfy booths of backCOUNTER or dining in COUNTER in never fails to impress me! Keep up the good work guys!
"we wernt planning to eat hear but came accross this with our 6 yo daugher. We were welcomed enthusiastically and I must say was a nice change to find those working there a pleasure to deal with. The food was a bit on the pricey side but you come to expect that when sitting in the middle of covent garden. We had pizza, mushroom and mussle Tapas. These dishes were exceptionally cooked and presented and we enjoyed every bit of it. The soft drinks we had were very nostalgic (ginger beer, dandilion and burdock etc). The whole experience was very good and my daugher loved it that the waiter gave her a pink badge when we left. Would eat here again."
"service, interesting food and fairly wallet-friendly wine-list are a good combination. The small portions suited us but my wife expected me to share her lentil based polpettine (?) which I had said I would not and then did not want to share my fritto misto, which she had said she would. As I like neither squid nor whitebait the only complaint I can make is about our breakdown in communication as the meal itself was excellent. And very convenient for a pre-theatre lunch at the Barbican and so much better than the restaurant there...."
"Great smoked food!!We had the beer can smoked whole chicken to share. Amazing BBQ taste, was piping hot like it had just come off the BBQ!Also had a cheeky side of baby back ribs nice and sticky and sweet! Will definitely return on our next visit to Putney.Cheers!"
"Was passing this little hidden gem last week when I noticed a great little offer, £14 for steak chips and half bottle of wine! To good to be true ? Apparently not . My husband went for the very unusual lobster burger which was out of this world. Topped with Welsh rarebit and lobster mayo on a soft brioche bun, ""help"" he said as the last morsel passed his lips ""I am addicted"" he shouted ! my steak was very good with fat chips and garlic sauce. We asked if we could book the offer again next Saturday night, they said yes. Not many central restaurants offer such value in such a prime position. Great experience"
Nice grill food with a great seletion. The chops were the best and cocktails to die for. I will be back again with my friends
Didn't like it very much. I would rather go to GBK where I would get taller burgers. Went there twice but not again
"My boyfriend and I live near by, so we just dropped in this restaurant once. It was horrible experience. Firstly , the food we ordered , none of them was tasty, I even couldn't finish my food as it tasted like medicine. Secondly the cocktail we orderred virgin marry was the most horrible drink we ever tried. Lastly, the service is very very very slow and poor ! so many waiters were walking around the table but NO one actually can service you with the simple request : the bill!. Finally , when we got our bill, we realised they charged bloody marry instead a virgin marry, really unprofessional. I would never go there again, and I would recommend my friends do NOT go there for overprice food and poor service."
My wife and I dropped into Parcel Yard at the end of a day out in London for a final drink. This is a perfect was to sit around and wait for your train to arrive at Kings Cross and they also serve food!You would know that you are in Kings Cross when you are in this pub as the setting is quirky and unique with lounging seats everywhere to enjoy.My wife and I would recommend as a pre or post drink if your landing at Kings Cross.
"I have walked past this restaurant a thousand times and finally plucked the courage to try it with a friend. The atmosphere was subdued, perhaps because it was a wet tuesday night following a bank holiday weekend. We were shown to a table at the back, past the aquarium housing the lobsters which I suppose one chooses from. Being less adventurous we settled for cheese burgers with a glass of wine each. A novelty was the ability to have rare burgers which was embraced with gusto. They were towers of freshness and simply delicious! Mine was accompanied by salad. My friend's by skin-on fries and amazingly light coleslaw. At £44 including service it was good value for the quality of produce. Service was friendly enough although we often had to call for a waiter, which was annoying as the place was empty. Highly recommended!"
some of the best sushi and sashimi outside of Japan. expensive compared to others but you get what you pay for.
"One of the best dates we've had in London - our waiter Jesse was fun, charming and helpful (definitely get the hummus!) we will be back soon."
"Love,love this place ! We got a deal with Time Out, 4 cocktails for £16.we were delighted,favourite was a porn star martini which was amazing.The staff were delightful,so nice and helpful.We weren't at all made to feel cheap using our voucher and it was altogether a super experience. We will definitely return esp for the happy hour (241 between 5 and 7)"
"ive been a customer of Pizza Express for years. I haven't been for a while though, there are so many other chains that do pizza well these days. I like my pizza well cooked, and that is what I usually get from Pizza Express. On this visit, the waiter was very friendly and efficient but my pizza was soggy. My husband had even ordered a pizza romana - which is specifically stated as being crispy. It was not, it too was soggy. We pointed this out, but it didn't seem to register. It looked like it was not cooked enough, or that the oven was not hot enough. Pizza restaurants should get this fundamental right! Disappointing, as I have always thought that this chain, one of the first I remember on the market, used to have a passion for good pizza."
"Enjoyed our first London brunch here, and it was worth the brief wait for a seat at the communal table. We even took home some wine and cheese to enjoy later - and those were great, too."
"We found this original pub just some steps away from the tourists stuff. There is a kindly owner in a family atmosphere, he recommended us his handmade pies and chips. And they was really delicious!Also the stuff was really kindly to our daughter and prepared a special meal for her.Everything was kindly, clean and perfect only the restrooms needs a renovation and some more attentions. ;-)"
"Three courses for £25 is excellent value, service is outstanding with very pleasant staff. Would recommend booking, people were constantly streaming in. Very generous portions, great atmosphere, we loved it."
"Gorgeous food served with style, meticulously prepared & served, small and quiet place, with a limited lunch menu but worth every penny !Would go back anytime .. Enjoy!"
"I found this restaurant on top table and we decided to give it a go before our theatre visit, we had a table on the mezzanine overlooking the bar below, great mix of the smart restaurant and the buzz of the bar below, food and service were both very good, had we not had to rush off for the theatre would have liked to relax in the bar below, would definitely recommend ."
"I go here every week so it's not a bad place. Some places you spend at least £6 (lunch) for sushi, you can come here and spend £8.50 (£2.50 more) with a drink and feeling really full. Tasty fresh fish plus friendly staff = very good place!"
"My girlfriend and I visited this place yesterday and I really don't understand how anyone who's ever been here could consider it anything other than awful. Upon entering we were ignored by the staff, who simply stared at us and we sat ourselves down. The place was largely empty, they were playing rather odd 80s saxophone music through what seemed to be cd player behind the counter and the 'vibe' was very strange for a restaurant. It feels like you're just sitting in a kebab shop waiting area, painted beige with a couple of tasteless paintings arranged.Service was strange, and our waiter didn't seem to know anything about the dishes on the very limited menu. Food Arrived quickly, to a point where my girlfriend wondered it if had already been prepared before we Arrived. I honestly think it must have been, and to top it off it was bland, lukewarm at best and the portions are truly miniscule. The menu is ENORMOUSLY overpriced for the food that you get. The waiter took away the cutlery before we'd finished eating at one point too, and I had to ask him to bring it back. It was bizarre.The 'fresh, pure' orange juice was blatantly a cheap one from concentrate and tasted like it came from Tesco's...as did, as someone else has said, the spring rolls, which were filled with some strange orange paste that neither of us could identify. Honestly, the whole experience was a huge disappointment, to a point where honestly we just felt ripped off. We decided to skip dessert, left hungry and went to Sainsbury's on the way home instead. £50 was such a disgrace for what we got I'm a bit annoyed I paid it, really. Especially as the staff ignored us on the way out, too.I'm not even someone who usually complains either. We were both shocked at this place, it was truly dreadful and if you're dumb enough to go here you'll wish you'd gone elsewhere."
"We visited Tom's Kitchen at the weekend for brunch, and had the full english, eggs Benedict with toast, tea, coffee. It started well, until the healthy juice on the menu, wasn't available, and a cloudy apply, mint concoction Arrived instead. Not great! Then the eggs arrive hard and the crispy bacon was pale and limp! The coffee was, on the other hand, good! Try better to get it right, I know you can do it!"
"Me and my boyfriend are regulars of this place, in that we get takeaway and/or eat at the restaurant a couple of times a month.The food is fantastic - the sushi is diveine - and the decor is great. When friends come to visit, we usually take them to Tootoomoo and we've recommended it to numerous people.All the staff members I have dealt with have been really friendly, except one that I spoke to the other day. He was a bald guy with a goatee and was working on the till by the front door. He was really snappy and service certainly wasn't delivered with a smile. I'm giveing this place full marks here, because it is fantastic, but I'm just hoping it will be noted that this guy's attitude was crap."
"Have been a few times now but went on my own last week. Had poached eggs and toast and it was brought to me exactly as I'd asked - no spinach, no dressing, just butter on the bread and a light sprinkling of salt. You'd be amazed at how difficult this can be perceived in other restaurants.The eggs had no taste of the vinegar used to cook them which for me was pure heaven. I would go so far as to say that Boyce Da Roca is the only place ive ever had poached eggs done so nicely and ive eaten in some high class establishments."
"Really worth having a meal here for quality of food and value in London. This is not a plush high class restaurant, but it's not trying to be that, its a French bistro style eatery with good varied menu, food of excellent quality at a very reasonable price. Lovely welcome by authentic French owner and staff."
"We took some friends here on a Saturday night and had a really good meal. We shared a couple of the platters to start and 3 of us had pizzas, and one had pasta, sharing a bottle of wine. All of the food was really good and the service was great too, really pleasant waiter. Very reasonably priced considering the location and I would definitely go back here again."
"This is the worst ever restaurant I have ordered and eaten from. We ordered, as take away, beef rendang (9.25), katsu curry (8.95) and pak choy with oyster sause (4.50) The beef rendang turned out to be only thick coconut gravy with what seemed to be a spoonful of the remains of a chunk of brisket; the katsu, instead of a chicken breast cutlet, were slithers of chicken skin and sinews; and the pak choy dish comprised only two miserable stalks of the vegetable that was completely overcooked. The rice was was dry and stale. I have never been more appalled that a Dim T kitchen, or any for that matter, has the audacity to serve their customer the food the way and manner in which they did No diner should be insulted this way. It is an absolute disgrace and we shall never dine at any Dim T again."
Its right in the heart of baker street where Maddame taussands and Planetarium is. Staff not that friendly and a bit hit and miss sorry.
"Lovely pub food and friendly atmosphere, enjoyed an impromptu dinner stop here one night after work. Fish was cooked well and salad not 'overdressed'."
"Just popped in for a drink on my way back to the hotel, staff are very friendly. Located opposite the IBIS"
Short and sweet menu. Unfortunately the waitress didn't highlight the specials which I didn't notice until I had ordered. Crust was very tasty but the centre of the pizza seemed a bit soggy. Great prices and definitely a cut above pizza express etc. It's quick in and out but sometimes that's what you want. I would definitely return.
"My husband discovered this restaurant on line and I am very glad he did. We went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful meal. The staff were welcoming and the service was friendly and efficient. We shared a sausage platter to start which was superb. My husband had fillet steak and I had ribeye, both were superb.Unfortunately we had no room for dessert, but I'm sure that if we had then that too would've been excellent. It was not cheap, but I do think it was well worth the money. They also have an excellent wine list."
"We dinned here Saturday 25th July and from start to finish it was great. We was seated in the bar area where we had our cocktails, then shown to our table. The staff are brilliant and very knowledgeable about the food ( yes Daniel is good), the food was delicious and the atmosphere is great. Was given a voucher by the Restaurant for the same deal so will defiantly be returning (We would even without the voucher)All in all we had a great night and was not rushed at all."
Great food great service and super ambient it was very delicate especially the Kobe beef fantastic !
Very loud but good service good Italian food and very buzzy. The menu accommodates all. Clean toilets and table not to close together. Easy parking outside. Well worth a visit and you must book
"The restaurant looks superb! I grabbed a take away, and found the service to be quick and the staff very upbeat and friendly, which was great to see them getting involved in the late Friday night mood :-)The cod and chips were delicious, the fish fresh and tasty, the batter crispy, and the chips cooked perfectly.I will definitely be going back!"
Beautiful homely food and the most friendly staff in town. I'm going back with my Irish friends to remind us of home and with my international friends to show them what Irish food is all about!
"After a long day in the big smoke, decided that the three of us would give Prezzo a go. The service was excellent, but the restaurant was all but empty with only 4 tables occupied. The time we visited was 6.30 on a Friday night.The food was OK, exactly what you'd expect from such an establishment, so all in all, it was a relaxing evening meal with family, exactly what I was looking for.My wife said that the area near the toilets smelt a bit, but I didn't notice anything when I visited. Is it worth a visit? If you want a decent meal, then yes. Highlight? The small desert and coffee combos are great, but if think other restaurants also do these now such as Pizza Express"
"Brillinat fun, the stafff were great and teh music was brilliant for a pre-party warm up. Super location and great if fabric is next on your list"
"Not far from Chapel Market, this is the place to end up at after visiting the nearby Alma and CBC.There is always a good selection of cask and keg craft beers. Beers are pricey, but the pizzas are great and good value. Service and atmosphere is great."
"Hampered by my dietry restrictions Prezzo did well indeed. Gluten-Free pizzas and a chef with a diveine sugo casa made life without cheese more than bearable. It was great! A mistake was made and apologized for, beautifully atoned for, in short an excellent choice."
"This is a long establishment and the menu has never changed for 30 years. Simple honest provincial French food. Chef, George comes from Mauritius. Not an extensive menu.. which is why it is so good. Great fish soup, the best and consistently great rack of lamb, the smoothest crÌ¬me brulee. The owner, Adele cannot be nicer o his customers."
"i went to Busaba Westfield for a meal yesterday with my work colleges since we haven't got a chance to do our xmas party. when we went to the restaurant it was pretty busy, but 9 of us was taken to seat within 3 mins. The staff was very friendly and all of my colleges was very impressed with the food. I had the grilled salmon dish,.i am not a fish person i have to say, but the salmon just cooked so perfect and taste absolutely Delicious. As a person travel many times to Thailand, i have to say Busaba Ethai is one of the best Thai restaurant in London. what more, i introduced the Thai Cuisine to a couples of my colleges has never had a Thai meal before. Threrfore, i am sure Busaba westfield will be definitely their choice when they come to do their shopping.Thank you Basaba Westfield for the great time, service and food!!! We will be back!"
"Very poor slow service_had to constantly try to get the waitresses attention. Then were told, in not a nice or apologetic way, that there was no time for us to have a final drink at our table and no space at the bar_even though 5 of us had just spent £300. Food was good, although very overpriced. Too many good places in Borough Market to bother going back here."
Well I was a member in the past but don't do London trips any more as I am part retired and today I was a guest of a member. I had forgotten how really upper class British this place is.. the traditional British decor and smartness of all the staff is exceptionally comforting. The service for food in the lounge areas is really perfect. I had a Caesar salad as well as tea and it was excellent. Thank you
"My date and I bought the Groupon voucher for a burger, sides and beer. I had the pulled pork burger which was fantastic, meat soft and juicy with a real kick of chilli, which is perfect for me. She had the charter house burger which was a large slab of beef burger covered with applewood smoked cheese and crispy bacon. Again juicy and full of flavour. Both had chips an shared the onion rings and homemade coleslaw. Cannot complain about any of it. Extremely good value for money, we couldn't finish it all!  I wasn't overly sure of what to expect, especially on a date, but we are pleasantly surprised. Service was great, staff real friendly and I highly recommend it. Will be coming back very soon.Thank you."
"Reared on Puddings and Pies so we just had to try this place while in London for the day. The Kate and Sydney Pudding was one of the best I have ever had and my Gran used to make some great ones. Loved the Pub but due to the tables being close in the Restaurant, it is a little claustrophobic and the day we went it was full of rather noisy people which marred the meal somewhat. That may be just us, but we like to be able to converse without having to raise our voices but the helpings were generous and the quality more than made up for the atmosphere on the day. Would certainly go again."
"We try to get to the Green Pea whenever we can. There's nowhere like it and that's the point. Just enjoyed another cosy evening with the food we love. Tom is the icing on the cake and other staff are very friendly, too. Best Guiness in London. Don't miss out - we are so pleased we found this gem."
"The food was good, the staff were attentive (without being ""in your face"") and pleasant. Wines reasonably priced. Added to this the view along the river, excellent value for the money."
"Being a fan of Jamie Oliver, I had to try his trendy eatery in Covent Garden. It did not disappoint. The way he is able to transform the simplest of ingredients into the most flavorful and complex combinations is the reason I continue to be the fan I am!"
"Pret is great for a quick healthy snack. It can be on the pricier side but it's worth it as the food is prepared fresh throughout the day. They have a range of sandwiches, salads and snacks."
Pret a manger in Piccadilly is a large well equipped restaurant. The coffee was good and the sandwiches and salads are freshly prepared. There is plenty of seating and a self clear system operates. The tables are clean as were the toilets. An ideal place for a quick coffee and sandwich for lunch while sight seeing or working.
