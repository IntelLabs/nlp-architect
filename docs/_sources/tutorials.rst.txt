Jupyter Tutorials
=================

Getting Started
---------------

To get started and familiarized quickly with the models and solutions NLP Architect has, we provide several tutorials as notebook in the well known Jupyter framework.

If you don't have Jupyter installed, follow these instructions to install:

- Install jupyter

    .. code:: python

        pip3 install jupyter

    .. note::
        Make sure your virtual environment is activated with NLP Architect installed.

- Once Jupyter is installed, go to NLP Architect root dir and start Jupyter Notebook:

    .. code:: python

        cd <NLP Architect root>
        jupyter notebook

- Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8888/
- Select a tutorial and start learning
