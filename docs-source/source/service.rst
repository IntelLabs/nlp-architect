Using as a REST service
#######################

Overview
========
NLP Architect server is a `hug <http://www.hug.rest/>`_ REST server that is
able to run predictions on different models configured using NLP Architect.
The server includes a web front-end exposing the model's annotations.

Currently we provide 4 services:

 1. :doc:`BIST <spacy_bist>` Dependency parsing
 2. :doc:`NER <ner_crf>`
 3. :doc:`Intent Extraction <intent>`
 4. :doc:`Machine Reading Comprehension <reading_comprehension>`

The server has two main components:

- :py:class:`Service <server.service.Service>` which is a representation of each model's API.
- ``server.serve`` module which is a `hug <http://www.hug.rest/>`_ application which handles processing of HTTP requests and initiating calls to the desired model.

The server supports extending with new services using provided API classes, see `Annotation Structure Types - Server Responses`_ for more details.

Running NLP Architect Server
============================
Install requirements
--------------------
The server requires extra python packages:

.. code:: bash

    pip install -r server/requirements.txt

Starting the server
-------------------
To run the server run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    hug -f serve.py -p 8080

The server will run locally on port 8080 and can be queried on ``/inference`` directive.

To access the visualization - http://localhost:8080

Requests
--------
The following headers are required when communicating with the server:

- Content-Type: "application/json" or "application/gzip"
- Response-Format: The response format, "json" or "gzip". The default response format is json.

The request content has the following format:

.. code:: json

    {
        "model_name": "ner" | "bist" | "intent_extraction" | "machine_comprehension",
        "docs":
        [
            {"id": 1,
            "doc": "Time flies like an arrow. fruit flies like a banana."},
            {"id": 2,
            "doc": "the horse passed the barn fell"},
            {"id": 3,
            "doc": "the old man the boat"}
        ]
    }

In the example above, ``model_name`` is the desired model to run the documents through and each input document is marked with an id and content.

Responses
---------
The server supports 3 types of Responses (see `Annotation Structure Types - Server Responses`_ bellow).

Example
-------

Request annotations using the :doc:`NER <ner_crf>` model:

.. code:: json

.. image :: assets/service_cards.png

- BIST parser - Core NLP models annotation structure



Visualization previews

- :doc:`Intent Extraction <intent>`:

  .. image :: assets/intent_service.png

- :doc:`Machine Reading Comprehension <reading_comprehension>`:

  .. image :: assets/mrc_service.png

- :doc:`BIST <spacy_bist>` parser:

  .. image :: assets/bist_service.png


Annotation Structure Types - Server Responses
=============================================
The server supports 2 types of annotation structure (responses from the server):

-  `Core NLP models annotation structure`_:
  A annotation of a Core NLP model (Part-of-speech (POS), lemma, dependency relations etc.), usually a word-to-label annotation.

-  `High-level models annotation structure`_:
  An annotation of a more high-level model (Intent Extraction, NER, Chunking, etc.). usually a span-to-label annotation used for higher level of nlp tasks and applications.


Core NLP models annotation structure
------------------------------------
:py:class:`CoreNLPDoc <nlp_architect.common.core_nlp_doc.CoreNLPDoc>` class is hosting the Core NLP models annotation structure.
(can be imported using: ``from nlp_architect.common.core_nlp_doc import CoreNLPDoc``).

.. code:: json

  {
    "doc_text": "<the_document_text>",
    "sentences": list of sentences, each word in a sentence is represented in \
      a dict (list(list(dict))). the dict is structured as follows:
              {
                "start": <start_index> (int),
                "len": <word_length> (int),
                "pos": <POS_label> (string),
                "ner": <NER_label> (string),
                "lemma": <Lemma_string> (string),
                "gov": <GOV_index> (int),
                "rel": <Dependency_Relation_label> (string)
               }
   }

High-level models annotation structure
--------------------------------------
:py:class:`HighLevelDoc <nlp_architect.common.high_level_doc.HighLevelDoc>` class is hosting the High-level models annotation structure.
(can be imported using: ``from nlp_architect.common.high_level_doc import HighLevelDoc``).

.. code:: json

  {
      "doc_text" : "<the_document_text>",
      "annotation_set" : list of all annotations in document (list(string)),
      "spans" : list of span dict (list(dict)), each span_dict is structured as follows:
              {
                "end": <end_index> (int),
                "start": <start_index> (int),
                "type": <annotation_string> (string)
               }
   }

Machine Comprehension structure
-------------------------------
Only for the MachineComprehensionApi response.
.. code:: json

 {
  "id": "<id>",
  "answer": "<answer_text>"
 }

Adding new services
===================
Adding a new service to the server
----------------------------------
All the services are declared in a ``JSON`` file found at ``server/services.json``.

In order to add a new service to the server you need to go over 3 steps:

1. Detect the type of your service suitable for your model, either Core NLP model or High-level model.
2. Create an API class for your service in  ``nlp_architect/api/`` folder. Make your class inherit from :py:class:`AbstractApi <nlp_architect.api.abstract_api.AbstractApi>` and implement all relevant methods. Notice that your `inference` ``class_method`` must return either :py:class:`CoreNLPDoc <nlp_architect.common.core_nlp_doc.CoreNLPDoc>` or :py:class:`HighLevelDoc <nlp_architect.common.high_level_doc.HighLevelDoc>`.
3. Add the definition of the new service to ``services.json`` as follows:

.. code:: json

    "<service_name>" : {"file_name": "<api_file_name>", "type": <"core"/"high_level>"}

.. .. include:: service_deploy.rst
