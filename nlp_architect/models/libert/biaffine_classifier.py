    """Implements a biaffine attention operator for binary relation classification.
    PyTorch implementation of the biaffine attention operator from "End-to-end neural relation
    extraction using deep biaffine attention" (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11275) which can be used
    as a classifier for binary relation classification.
    Args:
        in_features (int): The size of the feature dimension of the inputs.
        out_features (int): The size of the feature dimension of the output.
    Shape:
        - x_1: `(N, *, in_features)` where `N` is the batch dimension and `*` means any number of
          additional dimensisons.
        - x_2: `(N, *, in_features)`, where `N` is the batch dimension and `*` means any number of
          additional dimensions.
        - Output: `(N, *, out_features)`, where `N` is the batch dimension and `*` means any number
            of additional dimensions.
    Examples:
        >>> batch_size, in_features, out_features = 32, 100, 4
        >>> biaffine_attention = BiaffineAttention(in_features, out_features)
        >>> x_1 = torch.randn(batch_size, in_features)
