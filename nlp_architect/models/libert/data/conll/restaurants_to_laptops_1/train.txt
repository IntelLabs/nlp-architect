So	O
I	O
decide	O
to	O
report	O
back	O
to	O
the	O

because	O
it	O
was	O
completely	O
inedible	O

They	O
are	O
tasty	B-OP
,	O
but	O
I	O
suggest	O
only	O
eating	O
one	O
with	O
meat	B-ASP
because	O
they	O
tend	O
not	O
to	O
mesh	O
that	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
average	O
American	O

Look	O

the	O
appetizers	B-ASP
were	O

Please	O
take	O
my	O
advice	O
,	O
go	O
and	O
try	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
usually	O
good	B-OP
but	O
it	O
certainly	O
is	O
n't	O
a	O
relaxing	B-OP
place	B-ASP
to	O
go	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	B-OP
lunch	B-ASP
specials	I-ASP
just	O
because	O
it	O
tasts	O
the	O
same	O
with	O
other	O
regular	O

Finally	O
a	O
reliable	B-OP
Chinese	O
restaurant	O

Wonderful	O
at	O
holiday	O
time	O

everything	O
is	O
scrumptious	B-OP
,	O
from	O
the	O
excellent	B-OP
service	B-ASP
by	O
cute	B-OP
waitresses	B-ASP
,	O
to	O
the	O
extremely	O
lush	B-OP
atmosphere	B-ASP

I	O
would	O
recommend	B-OP
Roxy	O
's	O
for	O
that	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
for	O
their	O
food	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
ambiance	B-ASP
was	O
pretty	O
cool	B-OP
,	O
but	O
not	O
worth	B-OP
the	O
hassle	O
.	O

Boy	O
was	O
I	O
wrong	O
!	O

Need	O
I	O
say	O
more	O
?	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
very	O
good	B-OP
,	O
a	O
great	B-OP
deal	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
place	B-ASP
its	O
self	O
was	O
great	B-OP
.	O

Their	O
eggplant	B-ASP
is	O
so	O
delicate	B-OP
,	O
sweet	B-OP
tender	O
!	O

The	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
ok	B-OP
,	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
people	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
what	O
they	O
asked	O
for	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
best	O
hot	O

I	O
have	O
ever	O
eaten	O

The	O
falafal	B-ASP
was	O
rather	O
over	B-OP
cooked	I-OP
and	O
dried	B-OP
but	O
the	O
chicken	B-ASP
was	O
fine	B-OP
.	O

The	O
baked	B-ASP
clams	I-ASP
octopus	I-ASP
we	O
shared	O
as	O
appetizers	O
were	O
the	O
best	B-OP
we	O
've	O
ever	O
had	O
!!	O

Never	O
got	O
an	O
explanation	O
as	O
to	O
what	O

The	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
is	O
nothing	B-OP
special	I-OP
,	O
but	O
it	O
feels	O
like	O
a	O
Sushi	O
establishment	O
in	O
Tokyo	O
.	O

My	O
main	O
concern	O
was	O
the	O
sanity	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
that	O
was	O
being	O
sent	O
out	O
to	O
myself	O
and	O
others	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
lying	O
is	O
I	O
said	O
that	O
as	O
someone	O
who	O
has	O
worked	O
in	O
restaurants	O
since	O
the	O
age	O
of	O
fifteen	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
at	O

a	O
minimal	O
effort	O
on	O
the	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
restaurant	O
to	O
amend	O
the	O
situation	O

the	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
they	O
are	O
fantastic	B-OP

The	O
restaurant	O
is	O
dark	B-OP
and	O
not	O
very	O
attractive	B-OP
and	O
then	O
you	O
have	O
spot	B-ASP
lights	I-ASP
shining	O
on	O
you	O
putting	O
you	O
in	O
the	O
worst	B-OP
light	O
possible	O
,	O
reaching	O
for	O
sunglasses	O

Everything	O
about	O
this	O
restaurant	B-ASP
was	O
special	B-OP

When	O
going	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
nice	B-OP
dinner	B-ASP
,	O
I	O
like	O
a	O
nice	B-OP
ambiance	B-ASP
as	O
well	O
as	O
very	O
good	B-OP
food	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
waitress	B-ASP
suggested	O
glasses	O
of	O

that	O
went	O
very	O
well	B-OP
with	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
.	O

Do	O
n't	O
waste	B-OP
money	O
on	O
decor	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O
up	O
is	O
truly	O
unprofessional	B-OP
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	B-OP
staff	B-ASP
,	O
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O
one	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-OP
place	O

It	O
's	O
nice	B-OP
to	O
find	O
a	O

that	O
is	O
open	O
24	O

(	O
especially	O
in	O
downtown	O

The	O
ambience	B-ASP
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	B-OP

so	O
a	O
casual	B-OP
lunch	B-ASP
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	B-OP

The	O
brioche	B-ASP

is	O
a	O
cute	B-OP
and	O
sweet	B-OP
touch	O
to	O
a	O
most	O
memorable	O
meal	O
.	O

Lucky	O
Strike	O
is	O
a	O
great	B-OP
casual	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
absolutely	O
amazing	B-OP

From	O
the	O

it	O
looks	O
very	O
hidden	O

and	O
is	O
actually	O
an	O
old	O
warehouse	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
twice	O
to	O
this	O

I	O
had	O
their	O
eggs	B-ASP
benedict	I-ASP
for	O
brunch	O

which	O
were	O
the	O
worst	B-OP

when	O
I	O
have	O

Service	B-ASP
is	O
not	O
what	O
one	O
would	O
expect	B-OP
from	O
a	O
joint	O
in	O
this	O
price	O
category	O
.	O

Food	B-ASP
was	O
very	O
good	B-OP

not	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
consider	O
out	O
of	O
this	O

I	O
've	O

Until	O
you	O

that	O
their	O
five	O

is	O
meaningless	B-OP
and	O
your	O
wait	B-ASP
may	O
be	O
anywhere	O
from	O
two	O

twenty	O

it	O
may	O

Came	O
looking	O
for	O
this	O
place	O
because	O
I	O
heard	O
good	B-OP
things	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
more	O
wonderful	B-OP
than	O
the	O

(	O
which	O
is	O
exceptional	O
)	O
is	O
the	O

I	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
looked	O
very	O
appetizing	B-OP

delicious	B-OP
since	O
it	O
came	O
on	O
a	O
variety	O
of	O
fancy	B-OP

I	O
also	O
recommend	B-OP

thats	O
not	O

I	O
started	O
out	O
with	O
a	O
Bombay	B-ASP
beer	I-ASP
which	O
was	O
big	B-OP
enough	O
for	O

We	O
could	O
only	O
get	O
through	O
an	O
appetizer	B-ASP
and	O
cheese	B-ASP

We	O
ordered	O

dishes	I-ASP
from	O
the	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	B-OP
,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	B-OP
to	O
wait	O
for	O
it	O
.	O

Better	B-OP
than	O
the	O
bagel	O
shop	O
on	O
the	O

,	O
but	O
not	O
worth	B-OP
going	O
out	O
of	O
your	O
way	O
for	O
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
best	B-OP
comfort	B-ASP

You	O
will	O
be	O
very	O
happy	B-OP
with	O
the	O
experience	O

Also	O
,	O
they	O
do	O
not	O
take	O
credit	O

so	O
come	O
with	O
cash	O

My	O
son	O
and	O
his	O

both	O
wanted	O
cheeseburgers	B-ASP

they	O
were	O

If	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
dumpling	B-ASP

i	O
suggest	O
you	O
try	O
some	O
here	O

When	O
the	O

arrived	O
it	O
was	O
blazing	O
with	O
green	B-ASP
chillis	I-ASP

definitely	O
not	O
edible	B-OP
by	O
a	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
lobster	B-ASP
sandwich	I-ASP
and	O
it	O
was	O
FANTASTIC	B-OP

Apparently	O
,	O
the	O
good	B-OP

works	O
then	O
.	O

This	O
is	O
some	O
really	O
good	B-OP
,	O
inexpensive	B-OP
sushi	B-ASP
.	O

Overall	O
I	O
would	O
recommend	O
it	O
and	O
go	O
back	O
again	O

Glechik	O
might	O
be	O

too	B-OP
tiny	I-OP
for	O
a	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
cozy	B-OP
and	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
simply	O
GREAT	B-OP

If	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
mind	O
all	O
that	O
noise	O
then	O
go	O

Chart	O

Since	O
we	O
were	O
already	O
waiting	O

we	O

had	O
no	O
other	O
choice	O

to	O
accept	O
it	O

We	O
have	O
lived	O
in	O

Yeah	O
the	O

can	O
take	O
it	O
a	O

it	O
should	O
