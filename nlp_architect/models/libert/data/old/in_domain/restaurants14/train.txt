To	O
be	O
completely	O
fair	O

the	O
only	O
redeeming	B-OP
factor	O
was	O
the	O
food	B-ASP

which	O
was	O
above	B-OP
average	I-OP

The	O
food	B-ASP

with	O
a	O

This	O

got	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
most	O
overrated	B-OP
restaurants	O
in	O
Brooklyn	O
.	O

The	O

all	O
outstanding	B-OP

Went	O

last	O

for	O
2	O

and	O
was	O
n't	O
all	O
that	O
impressed	B-OP

It	O
was	O
rather	O
pathetic	B-OP
that	O
it	O
took	O
them	O
over	O
an	O
hour	O
to	O
seat	O
us	O

We	O
were	O
seated	O
promptly	B-OP
as	O
we	O
had	O
reservations	B-ASP
,	O
however	O
after	O
that	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
was	O
slow	B-OP
.	O

At	O
first	O
I	O
was	O
slightly	O
skeptical	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
sushi	O
restaurant	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
NYC	O
.	O

It	O
's	O
really	O
also	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
,	O
is	O
good	B-OP
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-ASP
are	O
friendly	B-OP
.	O

Suan	O
was	O
a	O
recommendation	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
glad	B-OP
we	O
heeded	O
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
pretty	O
good	B-OP
,	O
but	O
a	O
little	O
flavorless	B-OP
and	O
the	O
portions	O
very	O
small	B-OP
,	O
including	O
dessert	B-ASP
.	O

We	O
visit	O
at	O

once	O
a	O

It	O
is	O
set	O

from	O

and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O

noise	I-ASP

Also	O
,	O
the	O
place	O
is	O
popular	O
with	O
families	O

so	O
if	O
you	O

by	O

come	O

I	O

I	O
felt	O

most	O

the	O

I	O

HIGHLY	O
RECOMMENDED	B-OP
!!!!!	O

This	O
is	O
the	O

thing	O
in	O
Soho	O

Went	O
here	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
had	O
a	O
pleasant	B-OP
experience	O

We	O
parked	O
on	O
the	O
block	O

Nina	O
's	O
the	O
place	B-ASP
looked	O
nice	B-OP
,	O
with	O
people	O
obviously	O
enjoying	B-OP
their	O
pizzas	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
came	O
here	O
with	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
for	O
our	O
anniversary	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
highly	O
recommended	O
to	O
him	O
by	O
a	O
friend	O

For	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
o.k.	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
any	O
better	B-OP
than	O
what	O
you	O
get	O
at	O
a	O
good	O
neighborhood	O
restaurant	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
pot-stickers	B-ASP
which	O
were	O
great	B-OP
and	O
a	O
tempura	B-ASP
dish	I-ASP
that	I-ASP
was	I-ASP
great	I-ASP
.	I-ASP

I	O
think	O
the	O
stuff	B-ASP
was	O
better	B-OP
than	O
Disney	O
.	O

After	O
reading	O
the	O
good	O
reviews	O
of	O
this	O
restaurant	O
,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O
with	O
two	O

While	O
the	O

not	O
overly	B-OP
expensive	I-OP
,	O
in	O

,	O
there	O
is	O
definitely	O
better	B-OP
food	B-ASP
in	O
that	O

,	O
and	O
so	O
Sapphire	O
,	O
despite	O
it	O
's	O
lovely	B-OP

will	O
most	O

not	O

I	O
ordered	O
a	O
Chicken	B-ASP
Teriyaki	I-ASP

the	O

go	O
to	O
the	O
Lobster	B-ASP

a	O

I	O
had	O
a	O

The	O
chicken	B-ASP

the	O
