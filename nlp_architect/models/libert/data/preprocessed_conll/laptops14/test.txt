I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
the	O
best	B-OP
out	O
on	O
the	O
market	O
.	O

HOWEVER	O
I	O
chose	O
two	O
day	O
shipping	B-ASP
and	O
it	O
took	O
over	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
arrive	O
.	O

That	O
's	O
quite	O
a	O
bump	O
up	O
from	O
the	O
$	O
599	O
that	O
this	O
little	O
guy	O
sells	O
for	O
,	O
which	O
leaves	O
me	O
to	O
my	O
next	O
point	O
.	O

this	O
is	O
quite	O
smooth	B-OP
as	O
well	O
as	O
heavy	B-OP
and	O
can	O
easily	O
slip	O
through	O
the	O
hands	O

My	O
laptop	O
is	O
so	O
light	B-OP
that	O
I	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
me	O
anywhere	O

it	O
's	O
exactly	O
what	O
i	O
wanted	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
all	O
the	O
new	O
features	B-ASP
and	O
whatnot	O

You	O
can	O
do	O
absolutely	O
anything	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
fast	B-OP
and	O
stylish	B-OP
.	O

Finally	O
decided	O
to	O
try	O
a	O
MAC	O
because	O
there	O
were	O
too	O
many	O
choices	O
of	O
which	O
PC	O
's	O
to	O
buy	O
and	O
EVERYONE	O
who	O
had	O
a	O

said	O
"	O
buy	O
a	O
MAC	O
"	O

Can	O
you	O
buy	O
any	O
laptop	O
that	O
matches	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
of	O
a	O
MacBook	O
?	O

It	O
feels	O
cheap	B-OP
,	O
the	O
keyboard	B-ASP
is	O
not	O
very	O
sensitive	B-OP

That	O
defeated	O
the	O
whole	O
point	O
of	O
a	O

Though	O
please	O
note	O
that	O
sometimes	O
it	O
crashes	B-OP
,	O
and	O
the	O
sound	B-ASP

isnt	O
superb	B-OP

It	O
is	O
very	O
easy	B-OP
to	O
navigate	B-ASP
even	O
for	O
a	O

But	O
until	O
now	O
,	O
no	O

The	O
sound	B-ASP

the	O

The	O

the	O

the	O

the	O
