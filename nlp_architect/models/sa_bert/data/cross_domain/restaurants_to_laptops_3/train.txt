and	O
was	O
pretty	O

This	O

the	O

online	O
review	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
made	O
about	O
a	O
restaurant	O
in	O
my	O
life	O

Everyone	O
was	O
smiling	O
so	O
that	O
made	O
me	O
feel	O
welcome	O
.	O

Pricey	O
,	O
but	O
worth	O
a	O
try	O
,	O
at	O

once	O
.	O

No	O
thanks	O
!!!	O

I	O
only	O
tried	O
a	O
simple	O
dish	O
of	O
spinach	B-ASP
ravioli	I-ASP
in	I-ASP
a	I-ASP
light	I-ASP
oil	I-ASP
and	I-ASP
garlic	I-ASP
sauce	I-ASP
,	O
but	O
it	O
actually	O
faired	O
better	O
than	O
most	O
NYC	O
Italian	O
joints	O
I	O
've	O
tried	O
similar	O
dishes	O
at	O
.	O

I	O
'd	O
be	O
horrified	O
if	O
my	O
staff	B-ASP
were	O
turning	O
away	O
customers	O
so	O
early	O
and	O
so	O
rudely	O
!	O

The	O
dinner	B-ASP
was	O
ok	O
,	O
nothing	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
again	O
.	O

Nice	O
place	O
though	O
.	O

Kenny	O
the	O
owner	B-ASP
is	O
always	O
there	O
and	O
he	O
treats	O
my	O

we	O
are	O
part	O
of	O
his	O
family	O
.	O

Other	O
apetizers	B-ASP
and	O
food	B-ASP

I	O
think	O
I	O
've	O
had	O
some	O
the	O
best	O
meals	B-ASP
of	O
my	O
life	O
at	O
minnow	O
.	O

We	O
had	O
the	O
lobster	B-ASP
sandwich	I-ASP
and	O
it	O
was	O
FANTASTIC	O
.	O

The	O
lack	O
of	O
AC	B-ASP
and	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
million	O
swarming	O
bodies	O
(	O
although	O
everyone	O
is	O
polite	O
and	O
no	O
one	O
is	O
pushing	O
)	O
is	O
a	O
slight	O
turn	O
off	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
we	O
were	O
a	O
little	O
taken	O
aback	O
,	O
as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem	O
,	O
although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us	O
.	O

No	O
,	O
really	O
.	O

To	O
dine	O
at	O
Thalia	O
can	O
be	O
slightly	O
deceiving	O
because	O
while	O
its	O
beautiful	O
on	O
the	O
outside	O
,	O
its	O
so	O
bland	O
on	O
the	O
inside	O

It	O

I	O
would	O

Been	O
going	O
here	O
since	O
it	O
opened	O
have	O
seen	O
the	O
quality	B-ASP
value	I-ASP
decrease	O
considerably	O

They	O

the	O

food	B-ASP
and	O
refleshment	B-ASP
with	O
my	O

My	O
biggest	O
complaint	O
was	O
the	O
un-tasty	O
food	B-ASP
although	O
presented	O
well	O

SEA	O
has	O
become	O
so	O
popular	O
that	O
they	O
've	O

it	O

The	O
waitstaff	B-ASP
were	O
attentive	O

an	O
impressive	O

close	O

Always	O
a	O
nice	O
crowd	B-ASP

but	O
never	O
loud	O

Have	O
been	O
dozens	O
of	O
times	O
and	O
never	O
failed	O
to	O
enjoy	O
the	O
experience	O
.	O

I	O
'm	O
glad	O
I	O
was	O
introduced	O
to	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
and	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
rare	O
gem	O
in	O
NY	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
not	O
above	O
ordinary	O
and	O
the	O
beef	B-ASP

Do	O
n't	O
look	O
down	O

It	O
's	O
super-trendy	O
and	O
there	O
's	O
always	O
someone	O
to	O
take	O
that	O
empty	O
seat	O
,	O
so	O
it	O
seems	O
that	O
customer	O
service	B-ASP
has	O
been	O
deemed	O
not	O
of	O
the	O
essence	O
.	O

Not	O
only	O
is	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
great	O
,	O
but	O
forming	O
conversation	O
around	O
a	O
table	O
is	O
so	O
easy	O
beacuse	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
can	O
be	O
both	O
romantic	O
and	O
comfortable	O
.	O

Here	O
you	O
get	O
the	O
zen	B-ASP
feel	I-ASP
without	O
feeling	O
rigid	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O

This	O

All	O
in	O
all	O
the	O

My	O

The	O

of	O
the	O
night	O
was	O
the	O
mayonaisse	B-ASP
for	O
my	O
side	O
of	O

I	O
received	O
from	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
runners	I-ASP
,	O
which	O
is	O
not	O
good	O
considering	O
the	O
bill	B-ASP
was	O
nearly	O
$	O
100	O

Would	O
not	O
return	O

I	O
just	O

my	O
first	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O

truly	O
unprofessional	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O
staff	B-ASP
,	O
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O
one	O
this	O
is	O
a	O

We	O
'd	O
go	O

I	O
would	O
go	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
special	O
,	O
grilled	B-ASP
branzino	I-ASP

that	O
was	O
so	O
infused	O
with	O
bone	O

it	O
was	O
difficult	O
to	O
eat	O

The	O
host	B-ASP
(	I-ASP

and	O
servers	B-ASP
are	O
personable	O

I	O
have	O
tried	O
the	O
various	O

around	O
the	O

but	O
this	O
is	O
by	O
far	O
the	O
best	O
one	O
.	O

This	O
place	O
is	O
worth	O
an	O
one-hour	O
drive	O
.	O

The	O
staff	B-ASP
was	O
too	O
busy	O
ordering	O
sushi	B-ASP

Stumbled	O

this	O
gem	O
of	O
a	O
pizza	O
place	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
be	O
going	O
back	O
frequently	O

I	O
went	O

with	O
a	O

We	O
were	O

so	O
a	O
casual	O

here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	O

This	O
