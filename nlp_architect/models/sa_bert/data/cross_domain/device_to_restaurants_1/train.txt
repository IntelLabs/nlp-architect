,	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
so	O
well	O
now	O

that	O
i	O
do	O
n't	O
anticipate	O
any	O
problems	O

in	O
the	O

unless	O
your	O
a	O
professional	O
,	O
now	O
you	O
will	O
need	O
only	O
one	O
camera	O

this	O
one	O

i	O
have	O
several	O
tv	O
shows	O
on	O

so	O
they	O
are	O
divided	O
by	O
episode	O

it	O
is	O
great	O
sounding	B-ASP
,	O
even	O
with	O
the	O
supplied	O

the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O

is	O
a	O
thin	O
metal	O

that	O

i	O
currently	O

after	O
that	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
you	O
're	O
on	O
your	O
own	O
.	O

so	O
,	O
it	O
's	O
a	O
good	O
idea	O
to	O
purchase	O
an	O
extra	O
battery	O
to	O
insure	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
left	O
hanging	O

if	O
i	O
knew	O
then	O
what	O
i	O
know	O
now	O
i	O
would	O
have	O
paid	O
the	O
extra	O
to	O
get	O
an	O
ipod	O
&	O
avoided	O
the	O
zen	O

my	O
only	O
suggestion	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
lens	O
protector	O
to	O
help	O
protect	O
the	O
shooting	O
lens	O
(	O
the	O

will	O

many	O

and	O
i	O
'm	O

)	O

the	O
only	O
complaint	O
i	O
have	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
you	O
push	O
in	O
the	O
scroll	B-ASP
wheel	I-ASP
to	O

everything	O

about	O
the	O

i	O
would	O
say	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
major	O
issue	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
can	O
be	O
slightly	O
annoying	O
if	O
you	O

now	O

i	O
suddenly	O
have	O
no	O

it	O
