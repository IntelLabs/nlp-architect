All	O

my	O

that	O
the	O

about	O
it-especially	O
the	O
shows	B-ASP
and	O
actors	B-ASP

My	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
thougt	O
it	O
would	O

Hyde	I-ASP
Pub	I-ASP
for	O
our	O

and	O
to	O
our	O
surprise	O
it	O
was	O
fantastic	O

I	O
can	O
understand	O
the	O
prices	B-ASP
if	O
it	O
served	O
better	O
food	B-ASP
,	O
like	O
some	O
Chinese	O
restaurants	O
in	O
midtown/uptown	O
area	O

We	O
could	O
have	O
made	O
a	O
meal	O
of	O
the	O
yummy	O
dumplings	B-ASP
from	O
the	O
dumpling	O
menu	O
.	O

Be	O
prepared	O
to	O
wait	O
,	O
because	O
the	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
pretty	O
tiny	O
.	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
good	O
and	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
great	O
.	O

Any	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
reservation	B-ASP
you	O
'll	O
wait	O
for	O
max	O
5	O
minutes	O

so	O
have	O
a	O
drink	B-ASP
at	O
the	O

Go	O
hungry	O
and	O
enjoy	O
.	O

I	O
do	O
not	O
think	O
dinner	B-ASP
in	O
Manhattan	O
should	O
cost	O
$	O
400.00	O
where	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
swept	O
off	O
my	O
feet	O
.	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O
incompetent	O
!!	O

They	O
do	O
n't	O
walk	O
around	O
with	O
the	O
trays	B-ASP
of	I-ASP
Dim	I-ASP

I	O

with	O
two	O

dishes	B-ASP
that	O
were	O
not	O

to	O
be	O
a	O

thing	O
,	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
annoying	O

they	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
squeeze	O
me	O
in	O
at	O
6	O
after	O
i	O
called	O
the	O

before	O
my	O

told	O
me	O
they	O
'd	O
treat	O
us	O
well	O
for	O
the	O
occasion	O

I	O
think	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
spot	O
if	O
it	O
were	O
not	O
so	O
overpriced	O
and	O
overrated	O

But	O
the	O
coconut	B-ASP

was	O
good	O

We	O
ordered	O
the	O
chicken	B-ASP

but	O
what	O
we	O
got	O
were	O
a	O
few	O

chicken	B-ASP
,	O
all	O
dark	O

and	O
on	O

so	O
the	O

bland	O
and	O
disgusting	O

they	O
did	O
give	O
a	O
15	O

at	O
the	O
end	O
,	O
was	O
n't	O

I	O

might	O
be	O

They	O
are	O

I	O
suggest	O
only	O
eating	O
one	O

what	O
