The	B-ASP
Four	I-ASP

but	O
trust	O
me	O

they	O
will	O
charge	O
you	O
through	O
the	O

just	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O

"	O
I	O
've	O

I	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
there	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
worth	O
it	O
and	O
sadly	O
,	O

got	O
the	O
best	O
of	O
me	O
and	O
I	O
paid	O
dearly	O
for	O
it	O

All	O
in	O
all	O

the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
great	O
(	O
except	O
for	O
the	O
dessserts	B-ASP

The	O
environment	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
upscale	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
see	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
rich	O
guys	O
with	O

or	O
just	O
highly	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
going	O
for	O
the	O
food	B-ASP

it	O
will	O
not	O
be	O
worth	O

Yes	O

it	O
is	O
good	O

but	O
I	O
've	O
had	O

You	O
would	O

would	O

it	O

sadly	O

no	O

not	O
in	O
a	O

I	O
am	O
actually	O

to	O
have	O
spent	O
so	O
much	O
money	O
on	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
experience	O

I	O
literally	O
just	O
got	O
back	O
home	O
after	O
visiting	O
Casa	B-ASP
La	I-ASP
Femme	I-ASP
and	O
was	O
so	O
offended	O
by	O
my	O
visit	O
felt	O
it	O
necessary	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
warn	O
other	O

who	O

We	O
went	O
to	O
celebrate	O
two	O
birthdays	O
and	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
special	O
and	O
different	O
.	O

Our	O
visit	O
their	O
to	O
say	O
the	O

,	O
was	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
and	O
costly	O
experience	O

And	O
even	O
more	O
so	O
unpleasant	O
because	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
costly	O
for	O
such	O
an	O
unpleasant	O
experience	O

We	O
did	O
arrive	O
late	O
for	O
our	O
reservation	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
complain	O
too	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
wait	B-ASP
for	O
a	O
table	O
.	O

Although	O
we	O
were	O
told	O
10-15	O
minutes	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
like	O
45	O
minutes	O
.	O

We	O
were	O
ushered	O
to	O
the	O
bar	O
to	O
wait	O
momentarily	O
and	O
upon	O
arrival	O
were	O
so	O
excited	O
.	O

The	O
place	B-ASP
is	O
beautiful	O

The	O
hostess	B-ASP
was	O
very	O
pleasant	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
our	O
$	O
14	O
drinks	B-ASP
were	O
were	O
horrible	O

Once	O
we	O
finally	O
got	O
a	O
table	O
,	O
despite	O
indicating	O
we	O
wanted	O
an	O
alla	O
carte	O
menu	O
we	O
were	O
pushed	O
into	O
a	O
table	O
that	O
was	O
only	O
price	O
fixed	O

Since	O
we	O
were	O
already	O
waiting	O
so	O
long	O
,	O
we	O
felt	O
we	O
had	O
no	O
other	O
choice	O
but	O
to	O
accept	O
it	O
.	O

Our	O
experience	O
did	O
not	O
ever	O
get	O
any	O
better	O
.	O

For	O
each	O
course	O
we	O
waited	O
over	O
1/2	O
hour	O
to	O
45	O
minutes	O
and	O
were	O
never	O
offered	O
a	O
drink	O

We	O
also	O
asked	O
for	O
Hooka	O
six	O
times	O
and	O
the	O

kept	O
telling	O
us	O
one	O

never	O

with	O
the	O

After	O
the	O

asked	O
again	O

our	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
beverages	O
and	O
never	O
received	O
them	O

We	O
asked	O
for	O
sides	O
which	O
the	O
waiter	B-ASP
than	O
admitted	O
that	O
he	O
forgot	O
to	O
put	O
in	O
that	O
part	O
of	O
our	O
order	O

My	O
chicken	B-ASP

had	O
to	O

What	O
we	O

in	O
at	O
approximately	O
6:20	O

The	O

At	O

we	O
were	O
a	O

taken	O
aback	O

as	O
this	O
seemed	O
to	O
present	O
a	O
problem	O

although	O
the	O
restaurant	O
looked	O
fairly	O
empty	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
hastily	O
put	O
the	O
table	O
together	O
for	O
us	O

The	O
menu	B-ASP
is	O
fairly	O
simple	O
without	O
much	O

There	O
was	O
no	O

was	O
a	O
disappointment	O

we	O
went	O
with	O

The	O
appetizers	O
we	O
ordered	O
were	O
served	O
quickly	O
-	O
an	O
order	O
of	O
fried	B-ASP
oysters	I-ASP

clams	I-ASP
were	O
delicious	O
but	O
a	O
tiny	O
portion	O
(	O
maybe	O
3	O

The	O
lobster	B-ASP

(	O
special	O
of	O
the	O
day	O

were	O
ok	O

pretty	O

we	O
ate	O
our	O
appetizers	O
(	O
which	O
took	O
all	O
of	O
8	O
minutes	O

we	O
ordered	O
another	O

appeared	O

asked	O
us	O
if	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
order	O

We	O
replied	O
that	O
we	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
wait	O
5	O
more	O
minutes	O
if	O
that	O
was	O
okay	O

She	O
replied	O
"	O

it	O
would	O
be	O
more	O

was	O
very	O
close	O
by	O

and	O
she	O
told	O
us	O

we	O
did	O

The	O
food	O
arrived	O

I	O
heard	O
the	O

All	O

the	O

I	O

My	O
main	O
concern	O
was	O
the	O
sanity	O
of	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
that	O
was	O

on	O
the	O

of	O
the	O

that	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

an	O

that	O

We	O
ordered	O

nakgi-bokum	O

The	O
dishes	O
came	O
out	O
around	O
5	O

The	O
bibimbap	B-ASP

the	O

The	O
real	O

was	O
the	O

lack	O
of	O

at	O
the	O

I	O
was	O
appalled	O

It	O
was	O

with	O

over	O
a	O

My	O

wanted	O
to	O
switch	O
and	O
eat	O
his	O
salmon	O
instead	O
,	O
while	O

de-skinned	O
the	O

so	O
that	O
I	O

I	O

I	O

in	O

I	O
have	O
been	O

as	O
the	O
one	O

Flatbush	O

At	O
this	O
point	O
,	O
the	O
waitress	B-ASP
comes	O
over	O
and	O
asks	O
us	O
if	O
everything	O
was	O
okay	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
literally	O
so	O
shocked	O
that	O
I	O
was	O

anything	O

what	O
,	O
the	O

WALKED	O
away	O

So	O
,	O
I	O
switch	O
with	O
my	O

again	O

see	O
if	O
maybe	O
I	O
could	O
stomach	O
the	O
meat	O

spinach	O
again	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
spinach	B-ASP
was	O
so	O
undercooked	O
that	O
I	O
just	O
could	O
not	O

through	O
it	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O

.	O

I	O
've	O
had	O

So	O
I	O
decide	O

the	O

it	O
was	O
completely	O
inedible	O

she	O
only	O

the	O

her	O

opinions	O
are	O
often	O
out	O
of	O

nothing	O

The	O
