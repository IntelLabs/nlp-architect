Judging	O
from	O

this	O
used	O

the	O

they	O
were	O
very	O

They	O
never	O

us	O

and	O
threw	O
our	O

on	O
the	O
table	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
lousy	O
-	O
too	O
sweet	O
or	O
too	O
salty	O
and	O
the	O
portions	B-ASP
tiny	O
.	O

After	O
all	O
that	O

I	O
was	O

and	O
she	O
replied	O

I	O
had	O
to	O
ask	O
her	O
three	O

before	O
she	O
finally	O
came	O
back	O
with	O
the	O
dish	O

the	O

it	O
was	O
so	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
duck	B-ASP

special	I-ASP
on	O
my	O
last	O
visit	O
and	O
it	O
was	O

I	O

promising	O
myself	O
I	O
will	O
one	O
day	O
'	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try	O

'	O

And	O
I	O
hate	O
to	O
say	O
this	O
but	O
I	O
doubt	O
I	O
'll	O
ever	O
go	O
back	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
average	O
...	O
the	O
Thai	B-ASP
fusion	I-ASP
stuff	I-ASP
is	O
a	O
bit	O
too	O
sweet	O
,	O
every	O
thing	O
they	O
serve	O
is	O
too	O
sweet	O
here	O
.	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
I	O
moderately	O
enjoyed	O
was	O
their	O
Grilled	B-ASP
Chicken	I-ASP
special	I-ASP
with	I-ASP
Edamame	I-ASP
Puree	I-ASP
.	O

I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
Edamame	B-ASP
pureed	I-ASP
before	O
but	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
innovative	O
and	O
tasty	O
(	O
could	O
've	O
used	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O

Anyways	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
're	O
in	O

,	O
I	O
would	O
n't	O

to	O
find	O
something	O
,	O
rather	O
go	O
across	O
the	O
street	O
to	O
Tamari	O

The	O
decor	O
is	O
night	O
tho	O
...	O
but	O
they	O
REALLY	O
need	O
to	O
clean	O
that	O
vent	O
in	O
the	O
ceiling	O
...	O
its	O
quite	O
un-appetizing	O
,	O

kills	O
your	O
effort	O
to	O
make	O
this	O
place	B-ASP
look	O
sleek	O
and	O
modern	O

We	O
ate	O

The	O

The	O

with	O
a	O

nothing	O

out	O

The	O

the	O

I	O

not	O
a	O

,	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O

were	O
great	O

Frankly	O

when	O
you	O
compare	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
here	O
for	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
here	O
is	O
rather	O
good	O
,	O
but	O
only	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
to	O

for	O
it	O

I	O
like	O
the	O
somosas	B-ASP

and	O
the	O
chole	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
the	O
dhosas	B-ASP
and	O
dhal	B-ASP
were	O
kinda	O
dissapointing	O

The	O
service	B-ASP
varys	O
from	O
day	O
to	O
day	O
-	O
sometimes	O
they	O
're	O
very	O
nice	O
,	O
and	O
sometimes	O
not	O

The	O
kitchen	B-ASP

specify	O
if	O
you	O

your	O

its	O
rather	O

if	O
you	O

The	O

is	O
pretty	O

nice	O
for	O

a	O

I	O
almost	O
hesititate	O
to	O
write	O
a	O
review	O
because	O
the	O
atmosphere	B-ASP
was	O
so	O
great	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
hate	O
for	O
it	O
too	O

The	O

very	O
freindly	O

you	O

eating	O
in	O
a	O

I	O
like	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
dont	O
get	O
me	O
wrong	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
jsut	O
that	O
the	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
work	O
there	O
are	O
evil	O
and	O
incompetent	O
!!	O

The	O
service	B-ASP
was	O
terrible	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
wait	O
for	O
everything	O
and	O
ask	O
several	O
of	O
different	O
people	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
before	O
we	O
were	O
allowed	O
to	O
be	O
served	O
.	O

The	O
waitress	B-ASP
,	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
concerned	O
of	O
looking	O
good	O
than	O
actually	O
waitressing	O
.	O

After	O
dinner	O
the	O
manager	B-ASP
grabbed	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
,	O
asked	O
him	O
:	O
Where	O
are	O
you	O
from	O
...	O
maybe	O
you	O
dont	O
know	O
how	O
things	O
work	O
in	O
America	O
...	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
stormed	O
away	O
almost	O
teareyed	O
yelling	O
that	O
tips	O
are	O
the	O
only	O
thing	O
they	O
survive	O
on	O
.	O

We	O
did	O
tip	O
,	O
I	O
guess	O
the	O
model/waitress	O
just	O
wanted	O
more	O
and	O
complained	O
to	O
the	O
manager	O
.	O

The	O
whole	O
set	O
up	O
is	O
truly	O
unprofessional	O
and	O
I	O
wish	O
Cafe	O
Noir	O
would	O
get	O
some	O
good	O
staff	B-ASP
,	O
because	O
despite	O
the	O
current	O

this	O

I	O
came	O
into	O
the	O
city	O
to	O
try	O
out	O
this	O

because	O
a	O
friend	O
had	O
recommended	O
it	O
to	O
my	O

The	O
ambience	B-ASP
was	O
so	O
fun	O

and	O
the	O
prices	O
were	O
great	O

on	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
really	O
tasty	O

I	O
was	O
n't	O
thrilled	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
wait	O
on	O

for	O
thirty	O
minutes	O

I	O
guess	O
that	O
's	O
the	O
price	O
you	O

for	O
a	O
popular	O

A	O

they	O
were	O

Consequently	O

their	O

was	O
disappointed	O
with	O
the	O
service	B-ASP

I	O
thought	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
was	O
overated	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
pricey	O
side	O

If	O
you	O

its	O
the	O

However	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
ONLY	O
Taiwanese	O
restaurant	O

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
okay	O
and	O
the	O
prices	O
here	O
are	O
mediocre	O

You	O
ca	O

say	O
its	O

The	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
the	O

He	O
